  "Description": "More than 3000 inter-operable Z-Wave products throughout the world and more than 94 million products sold CVE-2020-9057 - CWE-311\n Z-Wave devices with system on chip (SoC) 100, 200, and 300 Series allows physically proximate attackers to replay, impersonate, and inject frames to the Z-Wave network due to missing encryption. CVE-2020-9058 - CWE-311\nUnauthenticated Z-Wave devices with SoC 500 Series allows physically proximate attackers to replay, impersonate, and inject frames that control the target device due to missing encryption. CVE-2020-9059 - CWE-400\nZ-Wave S0 Authenticated devices with SoC 500 series allows physically proximate attackers to inject infinite SECURITY_NONCE_GET that lead to battery exhaustion causing Denial of Service (DoS) on battery-powered devices due to uncontrolled resource consumption. CVE-2020-9060 - CWE-400\n Z-Wave S2 devices with SoC 500 series allows physically proximate attackers to inject infinite SECURITY_2_NONCE_GET that leads to a partial Denial of Service (DoS) due to high CPU/MCU consumption. CVE-2020-9061 - CWE-285\nZ-Wave controllers with SoC 500 series (S0 and S2) allows physically proximate attackers to inject an invalid device Node Information (NIF) frame that modifies the controller stored NIF causing Denial of Service (DoS) on the target Z-Wave S0 authenticated device due to improper authorization.",
  "ID": "VU#142629",
  "IDNumber": "142629",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Z-Wave products are used in millions of devices in commercial and the smart home ecosystem (access controls, cameras, Amazon Echo, etc). An attacker may cause a denial of service.",
  "Keywords": "",
  "Overview": "Z-Wave protocol suffers from multiple vulnerabilities. Older chipsets, 100, 200, and 300 series, are missing encryption capabilities. The newer chipsets, the 500 series, have varying levels of encryption capabilities and may also suffer from denial of service.",
