  "Description": "There is a Java security flaw that allows a malicious applet to disable all security controls in Netscape Navigator 4.0x.  After disabling the security controls, the applet can do whatever it likes on the victim's machine, including arbitrarily reading, modifying, or deleting files.\n\nThis flaw is in the implementation of the \"ClassLoader\" mechanism that handles dynamic linking in Java.  Despite changes in the ClassLoader implementation in JDK 1.1 and again in JDK 1.2 beta, ClassLoaders are still not safe; a malicious ClassLoader can still\noverride the definition of built-in \"system\" types like java.lang.Class.  \n \nThe flaw is not directly exploitable unless the attacker can use some other secondary flaw to gain a foothold.",
