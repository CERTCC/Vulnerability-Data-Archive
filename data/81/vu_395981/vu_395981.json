  "Description": "CVE-2018-12037\nThere is no cryptographic relation between the password provided by the end user and the key used for the encryption of user data. CVE-2018-12038\nKey information is stored within a wear-leveled storage chip. According to National Cyber Security Centre - The Netherlands (NCSC-NL), the following products are affected by\u00a0CVE-2018-12037: Crucial (Micron) MX100, MX200 and MX300 drives\nSamsung T3 and T5 portable drives\nSamsung 840 EVO and 850 EVO drives (depending on a BIOS setting: In \"ATA high\"\u00a0mode these devices are vulnerable, In \"TCG\" or \"ATA max\" mode these devices are NOT vulnerable.) According to NCSC-NL, the following products are affected by\u00a0CVE-2018-12038: Samsung 840 EVO According to NCSC-NL, BitLocker, as bundled with\u00a0Microsoft Windows relies on hardware full-disk encryption by default if the drive indicates that it can support this. This means that this encryption implementation in combination with the above products is vulnerable. The researchers have reported the above products as vulnerable. Other products were not tested.",
  "ID": "VU#395981",
  "IDNumber": "395981",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "These vulnerabilities allow for full recovery of the data without knowledge of any secret, when the attacker has physical access to the drive.",
  "Keywords": "VU#760533",
  "Overview": "There are multiple vulnerabilities in implementations of the TCG Opal standard with Self-Encrypting Disks (SEDs), which can allow an attacker to decrypt contents of an encrypted drive.",
