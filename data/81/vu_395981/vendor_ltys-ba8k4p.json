  "VendorStatement": "Self-Encrypting Solid-State Drive Research Study: VU#395981, CVE-2018-12037, \nCVE-2018-12038 All Seagate Secure\u2122 TCG Enterprise SSC and TCG Opal SSC based SED and FIPS \ndevices across all interfaces (SAS, SATA and NVMe) provide certified \nmitigations to the threats referenced in the recent research study entitled \n\"Self-encrypting deception: weaknesses in the encryption of solid-state drives \n(SSDs)\" by Carlo Meijer and Bernard van Gastel at Radboud University in the \nNetherlands.\u00a0Specifically, the threats referenced in this study are: Password and DEK not linked\nSingle DEK used for the entire disk\nLack of entropy in randomly generated DEKs\nWear leveling, power-saving mode (e.g. DEVSLP)\nGeneral implementation issues (i.e. incorrect crypto usage)\nJTAG access\nVendor diagnostic commands access\nArbitrary unsigned code execution, and\nSame intermediate encryption key for all MEKs These threats are addressed in Seagate Secure SED and FIPS devices which are \nthoroughly validated by independent labs that certify Seagate Secure products \nagainst the FIPS 140 Standard and Common Criteria FDE Encryption Engine profile. Seagate leads the industry with security certifications and transparency as a \nresult of our FIPS 140 and Common Criteria Certificates and corresponding \nSeagate Secure Security Policies. These certifications provide public \nvisibility to the implemented security policies and assurance that device \nprotection, cryptography and key management are implemented to publicly \nrecognized security standards. Common Criteria Certificate - CCEVS-VR-VID10857-2018\nFIPS 140 Certificate Examples - #3316, #3252, #2634 (Refer to Seagate website \nfor additional certificates)"
