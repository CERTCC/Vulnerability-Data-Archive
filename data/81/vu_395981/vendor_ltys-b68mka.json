  "VendorStatement": "Encryption with BitLocker depends on the correct setting of the Group Policy. More information about this Group Policy can be found via the following location (Microsoft URL). Changing the default setting is not sufficient to mitigate the risk because it does not affect the vulnerability in already encrypted data. Only a\u00a0complete new installation, including removal and reformatting\u00a0of data, enforces encryption via BitLocker."
