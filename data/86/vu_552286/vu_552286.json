  "Description": "The open source EDK2 project provides a reference implementation of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). Researchers at The MITRE Corporation have discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the EDK2 Capsule Update mechanism. Commercial UEFI implementations may incorporate portions of the EDK2 source code, including the vulnerable Capsule Update code. Buffer overflow in Capsule Processing Phase - CVE-2014-4859\nDuring the Drive Execution Environment (DXE) phase of the UEFI boot process, the contents of the capsule image are parsed during processing. An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the capsule processing phase that can cause the allocation of a buffer to be unexpectedly small. As a result, attacker-controlled data can be written past the bounds of the buffer. Write-what-where condition in Coalescing Phase - CVE-2014-4860\nDuring the Pre-EFI Initialization (PEI) phase of the UEFI boot process, the capsule update is coalesced into its original form. Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the coalescing phase that can be used to trigger a write-what-where condition. For more details, please refer to MITRE's vulnerability note.",
