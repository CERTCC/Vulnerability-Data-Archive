  "VendorStatement": "We can confirm that described vulnerability is present in the HSRP\nand, at the present time, there is no workaround for it. Customers\nmay consider using HSRP and IPsec combination as described in\nhttp://www.cisco.com/networkers/nw00/pres/2402.pdf However, this\nsolution does not scale well. Cisco is deliberating usage of IP authenticated header for HSRP\nand VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol, RFC2338) in the future\nreleases of IOS. However, there are some other factors that must be considered in\nthis context: - this vulnerability can be exploited only from the local segment\n  (not over the Internet),\n- the same effect, denial of service, can be produced by using ARP,\n  which can not be protected in any way The last issue is especially important since it may cause a false\nsense of security if user is using a hardened version the protocol\n(whichever protocol). Even by using VRRP and ESP+AH option, an\nattacker can still disrupt the network by using ARP.",
