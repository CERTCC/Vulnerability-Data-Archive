  "Description": "CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer - CVE-2018-16986 Both Texas Instruments microcontrollers CC2640 and CC2650 BLE-Stacks contain a memory corruption vulnerability resulting from the mishandling of BLE advertising packets. The function llGetAdvChanPDU that is part of the embedded ROM image in both chips handles the incoming advertising packets and parses their headers. It copies the contents to a separate buffer provided by the calling function. The incorrect length of the packet is taken and ends up being parsed as larger packets than originally intended. If the incoming data is over a certain length, the function will call the halAssertHandler function, as defined by the application running on top of the stack, and not stop execution. Since the flow of execution does not stop, it will copy the overly large packet to the buffer and cause a heap overflow.",
  "ID": "VU#317277",
  "IDNumber": "317277",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Using a specially crafted set of packets, an attacker can both control the data of the overflow, and the length of it, which may lead to remote code execution on the targeted BLE chip. An attacker needs to be within physical proximity to the device while it is in scanning mode to trigger vulnerable code. This memory corruption can lead to code execution on the main CPU of the device, which could have the potential to affect other devices across a network if the origin is a networked device. Given the nature of embedded devices, it is possible that a broader set of devices are impacted than what is listed in this publication.
