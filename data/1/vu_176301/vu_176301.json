  "Description": "CWE 798: \u200bUse of Hard-Coded Credentials - CVE\u20132018-5399\nThe DCU 210E firmware contains an undocumented Dropbear SSH server with a hardcoded username and password. The password is easily susceptible to cracking. CWE-346:\u200bOrigin Validation Error - CVE\u20132018-5400\nThe Auto-Maskin products utilize an undocumented custom protocol to set up Modbus communications with other devices without validating those devices. CWE-319:\u200b Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information - CVE\u20132018-5401\nThe devices transmit process control information via unencrypted Modbus communications. CWE-319:\u200b Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information - CVE\u20132018-5402\nThe embedded webserver uses unencrypted plaintext for the transmission of the administrator PIN.",
