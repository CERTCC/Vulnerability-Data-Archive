  "Status": "Not Affected",
  "Vendor": "lwIP",
  "VendorInformation": "EAP was never used by any lwIP user. The lwIP PPP support is mostly used with cellular modems only as a framing protocol limited to the serial link between the MCU and the modem were security is less relevant because it is not authenticated anyway. The lwIP so far has had support for  PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP (tied to MPPE keys exchange), but EAP has never been enabled from compile time.",
  "VendorRecordID": "CHEU-BLHRNV",
  "VendorReferences": "If you plan to compile lwIP with EAP support, please ensure you apply both the patches linked below as it also resolves the issue of preventing response to unsolicited EAP messages as well as buffer overflow due to the bounds check logic flaw. http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lwip.git/commit/?id=2ee3cbe69c6d2805e64e7cac2a1c1706e49ffd86\nhttp://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lwip.git/commit/?id=d281d3e9592a3ca2ad0c3b7840f8036facc02f7b",
  "VendorStatement": "lwIP is a bit different than pppd, we added a lot of preprocessor directives to enable or disable features at compile time in order to reduce binary size output and EAP is disabled by default: http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lwip.git/tree/src/include/netif/ppp/ppp_opts.h?id=d281d3e9592a3ca2ad0c3b7840f8036facc02f7b#n234 \nhttp://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lwip.git/tree/src/netif/ppp/eap.c?id=d281d3e9592a3ca2ad0c3b7840f8036facc02f7b#n46 \nThat is, no product using lwIP were ever shipped with the EAP code compiled at all."
