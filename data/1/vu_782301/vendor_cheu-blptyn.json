  "Revision": 4,
  "Status": "Affected",
  "Vendor": "Red Hat, Inc.",
  "VendorInformation": "Redhat has created a Bug ID 1800727 for this vulnerability. RedHat has put our updates for their supported platforms. The vendor URL section has links to these updates. It is assumed that EAP needs to be enabled for this vulnerability to be exposed. However this is not the case as shown by Ilja Van Spronkel that even if EAP is disabled, an unauthenticated and unsolicited EAP packet can be send to trigger this vulnerability.",
  "VendorRecordID": "CHEU-BLPTYN",
  "VendorReferences": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-8597\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1800727\nhttps://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0630",
  "VendorStatement": "The ppp packages distributed with Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions are compiled using gcc's stack-protector feature. The \"Stack Smashing Protection\" may help mitigate code execution attacks for this flaw and limit its impact to crash only. This flaw only affects pppd servers and clients when EAP negotiation is used. pppd will refuse to do EAP negotiation unless it has an appropriate secret to use. The secret has to be added to /etc/ppp/chap-secrets. EAP can use CHAP or SRP as the underlying flavour of authentication, Red Hat packages are not compiled with SRP code."
