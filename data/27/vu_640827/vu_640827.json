  "Resolution": "Obtain and apply the fix on all SP system control workstations and nodes as soon as possible. See the instructions below for obtaining the appropriate PTF(s) containing the fix for each release of PSSP. Follow the instructions in the appropriate README file to enable secure file collections. PSSP 3.1.1     ssp.sysman.README.IY20699\n    PSSP 3.2       ssp.sysman.README.IY28063\n    PSSP 3.4       ssp.sysman.README.IY28065 IMPORTANT: Simply applying the PTF is not sufficient to correct the File Collections security vulnerability. The process to enable Secure File Collections, as documented in the README file, must be completed in order to correct the vulnerability. Solution: There are APARs created for all supported PSSP releases. The PTFs addressing those APARs are now available in the indicated PTF Set. PSSP Rls     APAR     PTF #    PTF Set # PSSP 3.1.1:  IY20699  U482380    24\n   PSSP 3.2:    IY28063  U482385    18\n   PSSP 3.4:    IY28065  U482395     6 The fix can be obtained by ordering the specific PTF for your release from 1-800-CALLAIX or your country support center. The fix can also be downloaded by selecting the appropriate APAR number from IBM@server Support web page\nat URL: http://techsupport.services.ibm.com/server/fixes",

To disable File Collections, run the following command under the root userid on the SP system's control workstation: spsitenv filecoll_config=false To verify that File Collections has been disabled, run the following command: splstdata -e | grep filecoll_config",
