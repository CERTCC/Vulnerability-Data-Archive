  "Description": "Several D-Link routers contain CGI capability that is exposed to users as /apply_sec.cgi, and dispatched on the device by the binary /www/cgi/ssi. This CGI code contains two flaws: The /apply_sec.cgi code is exposed to unauthenticated users. The ping_ipaddr argument of the ping_test action fails to properly handle newline characters. Any arguments after a newline character sent as ping_ipaddr in a POST to /apply_sec.cgi are executed on the device with root privileges. The following devices are reported to be vulnerable: DIR-655\nDIR-866L\nDIR-652\nDHP-1565\nDIR-855L\nDAP-1533\nDIR-862L\nDIR-615\nDIR-835\nDIR-825 We have made a proof-of-concept exploit available, which will disable network connectivity for one minute on affected devices.",
  "ID": "VU#766427",
  "IDNumber": "766427",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By performing an HTTP POST request to a vulnerable router's /apply_sec.cgi page, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute commands with root privileges on an affected device. This action can happen as the result of viewing a specially-crafted web page.",
