  "VendorInformation": "Please note that we believe that the Trend Micro SSL product is not susceptible \nto this supposed vulnerability. We do not provide or support Domain Validated \n(DV) certificates from our product. We do leverage the domain based validation \nmethodology for the management of domains within customer accounts but \ncustomers must have already passed either Organization Validation (OV) or \nExtended Validation (EV) vetting before they can use their accounts. Both OV \nand EV vetting require the manual validation of a customer\u2019s \u00a0corporate \ninformation and account administrator. In addition, Trend Micro only uses the \nspecific email addresses allowed by the CA-Browser Forum Baseline Requirements \nSection 11.1.1 for confirmation of control of domains, which is the same method \nused by all other Certification Authorities and browsers worldwide.\u00a0 All our \ncustomers must also have a subscription account requiring an extended \nrelationship with us removing the possibility of any \u2018drive by\u2019 transactional \ncertificate issuances.",
