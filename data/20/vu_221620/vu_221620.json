  "Description": "Blue Coat Security Advisory SA77 states: SGOS supports multiple types of authentication realms for authenticating administrative and proxy users. Most authentication realms use remote authentication databases. Locally defined users and user lists are in the local authentication realm. The local authentication realm is typically used for administrative and console access, but can be used for proxy users as well. When local users change their password, are deleted, or are removed from or added to a user list, changes may take up to 15 minutes to take effect due to caching. If another password-related event (such as a correct login with the new password or a rejected login due to incorrect password) occurs, the time for changes to take effect may be shorter. An attacker who knows the account password can exploit this gap to gain unauthorized administrative access through the Management Console, or the SSH or serial console if the local realm is used for console access. A deleted user would continue to have network access for up to 15 minutes. Additional details may be found in the full Blue Coat Security Advisory.",
