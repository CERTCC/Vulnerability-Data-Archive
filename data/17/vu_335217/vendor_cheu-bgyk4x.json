  "VendorStatement": "Cloudflare is aware of the issue and has done some mitigations in the past. Most of the cause is due to back end web server or origin of the content. In addition to those blog posts, we direct customers to information about how our cache works: https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172516-Understanding-Cloudflare-s-CDN#h_51422705-42d0-450d-8eb1-5321dcadb5bc Most CDNs cache what customer origins tell us to cache (respecting cache control headers), so most of these cache poisoning issues are on the origin side and not the CDN side. Cloudflare sensitive to what the customer requests to be cached, when possible Cloudflare prevents caching of dynamic content that is specific to one user (for example a distinct Set-Cookie header observed)."
