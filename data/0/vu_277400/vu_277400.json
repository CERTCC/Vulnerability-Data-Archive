  "Description": "The update that Microsoft has released for meltdown on x64 versions of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 incorrectly sets the permission bit for memory accessible from unprivileged user space. As a result, such platforms that have the meltdown update installed, which was released in January 2018 will not properly protect the contents of system memory..",
