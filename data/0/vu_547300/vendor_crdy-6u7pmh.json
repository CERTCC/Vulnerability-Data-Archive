Three of the vulnerabilities are denials of service,\n    but the other is a buffer overflow that is expected to create\n    remote unauthorized access vulnerabilities in other applications. In particular, any connection that the mysql daemon will accept\n    may be vulnerable. In the default configuration of mysql, that\n    would be a local unauthorized access vulnerability, but mysql can\n    be configured to listen for network connections from remote hosts,\n    which would then enable remote unauthorized access. Any program\n    that calls the SSL_get_shared_ciphers() function may be vulnerable. 29 September 2006 Update: The initial fix for this vulnerability was\n    incomplete, and the fault in the fix could enable a Denial of Service\n    attack in some cases of the attack described in CVE-2006-2940.",
