  "Impact": "By convincing a user to follow a URL or read an HTML email message containing malicious script, and attacker could take any action with the privileges of the user executing the script. This could include opening new browser windows to different sites in different security zones, reading or modifying information in open browser windows, reading files on the local file system, and executing commands that are in a location known to the attacker. An attacker who is able to obtain cookies used for authentication may be able to impersonate a legitimate user and obtain sensitive data such as passwords or credit card information. By leveraging features of the Microsoft HTML Help system (VU#25249), an attacker could execute commands with parameters or cause arbitrary files to be downloaded to a known location on the local system, subject to the user's privileges.",

The external method caching vulnerability was addressed by MS02-068, which supersedes MS02-066. As of May 2003, the clipboardData method caching vulnerability has not been addressed. Both the external and clipboardData vulnerabilities affect Internet Explorer version 6.0 SP1.",

  "Workarounds": "Disable Active scripting At a minimum, disable Active scripting in the Internet zone and the zone used by Outlook, Outlook Express, and any other software that uses Internet Explorer to render HTML. Instructions for disabling Active scripting can be found in the CERT/CC Malicious Web Scripts FAQ. Apply Outlook Email Security Update The Outlook Email Security Update configures Outlook 2000 and Outlook 98 to use the Restricted sites zone to open email. By default, Active scripting is disabled in the Restricted sites zone. Outlook Express 6.0 and Outlook 2002 include the functionality provided by the Outlook Security Update. Outlook 2000: http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/Out2ksec.aspx Outlook 98: http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/Out98sec.aspx\nRestrict HTML Help commands Restrict the execution of the Shortcut and WinHelp HTML Help commands to specified folders, or disable the commands entirely. This will prevent malicious scripts from downloading arbitrary files and executing arbitrary commands with parameters via HTML Help. It will also limit the ability of HTML Help to open URLs and execute commands. http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=810687\nMicrosoft has also released an updated version of HTML Help (811630) that is available via Windows Update: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;en-us;q811630\nFilter Script Code It may be possible to use an application layer filter to detect and block or disable script code within HTML data.",

The impact is similar to that of a cross-site scripting vulnerability, allowing an attacker to access data in other sites, including the Local Computer zone.",
