Conditions: The issue only happens when a privileged user (one with a privilege level allowing it to execute the \"test aaa\" command, by default, level 15) executes the \"test aaa\" command and the device is configured to log events at level 5 (notifications) or above. Workaround: Configure the PIX/ASA device not to log a message 111008 by entering the following command in global configuration mode: no logging message 111008 Not logging message 111008 does NOT affect the functioning of the \"test aaa-server\" command. Further Problem Description: Starting with release 8.0.2.11 for the 8.0 train, 7.2.2.34 for the 7.2 train, 7.1.2.61 for the 7.1 train and 7.0.7.1 for the 7.0 train, the password is replaced with asterisks.
