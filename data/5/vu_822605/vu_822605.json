  "Description": "CVE-2019-3906:  Hardcoded Credentials (Admin Access to Service) \nPremiSys contains hard-coded credentials (CWE-798) that provide administrator access to the entire service via the PremiSys Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Service endpoint. These credentials can be used by an attacker to access and modify the badge system database. **The CVSS score listed at the end of this publication is in regards to CVE-2019-3906. CVE-2019-3907: Weak Hashing/Encryption\nA known-weak encryption method (Base64 encoded MD5 hashes - salt + password) is used to store user credentials and other sensitive information. CVE-2019-3908: Hardcoded Password\nThe PremiSys backup files can be unzipped using a hardcoded password. CVE-2019-3909: Default Database Credentials (Full Access to Service Databases)\nA default database username and password are used to install the IDenticard service. Users cannot change this password without sending custom passwords to the vendor directly in order to receive an encrypted variant to use in their configurations.",
