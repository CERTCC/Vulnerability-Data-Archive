  "Description": "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') - CVE-2018-5390\nLinux kernel versions 4.9+ can be forced to make very expensive calls to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() for every incoming packet which can lead to a denial of service. CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')  - CVE-2018-6922\nA TCP data structure in supported versions of FreeBSD (11, 11.1, 11.2, 10, and 10.4) use an inefficient algorithm to reassemble the data. For both vulnerabilities, an attacker can induce a denial of service condition by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port. Thus, the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses.",

  "Impact": "An remote attacker may be able to trigger a denial-of-service condition against a system with an available open port.",
  "Keywords": "",
  "Overview": "The Linux kernel versions 4.9+ and supported versions of FreeBSD are vulnerable to denial of service conditions with low rates of specially modified packets.",
