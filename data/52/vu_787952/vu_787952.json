  "Description": "Many Android mobile devices come with OEM-pre-installed apps. Some apps have been identified as having incorrect access control settings, allowing malicious third-party apps to exploit and bypass system permissions and settings. Additionally, some Android and iOS apps embed a hard-coded cryptographic key or use a weak cryptographic algorithm that allows an attacker to obtain elevated access. Kryptowire has released a paper documenting 38 vulnerabilities in various Android smartphone devices. These vulnerabilities are largely attributed to incorrect user permissions and access control settings via pre OEM pre-installed apps, and may be exploitable via malicious third-party apps installed by the user. Two of the vulnerabilities are exploitable via the Android debug bridge (adb). Kryptowire, in collaboration with DHS S&T and the NCCIC, previously discovered and reported the following vulnerabilities. CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\nThe software does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate. When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The software might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the software might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host. Vulnerable app: (CVE-2017-13105) Virus Cleaner ( Hi Security ) - Antivirus, Booster, 3.7.1.1329 CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\nThe software contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data. Vulnerable apps: (CVE-2017-13100) The Moron Test, 6.3.1, 2017-05-04, iOS\n(CVE-2017-13101) musical.ly - your video social network, 6.1.6, 2017-10-03, iOS\n(CVE-2017-13102) Asphalt Xtreme: Offroad Rally Racing, 1.6.0, 2017-08-13, iOS\n(CVE-2017-13104) UberEATS: Uber for Food Delivery, 1.108.10001, 2017-11-02, iOS\n(CVE-2017-13105) Virus Cleaner ( Hi Security ) - Antivirus, Booster, 3.7.1.1329, 2017-09-13, Android\n(CVE-2017-13106) CM Launcher 3D - Theme,wallpaper,Secure,Efficient, 5.0.3, 2017-09-19, Android\n(CVE-2017-13107) Live.me - live stream video chat, 3.7.20, 2017-11-06, Android\n(CVE-2017-13108) DFNDR Security: Antivirus, Anti-hacking & Cleaner, 5.0.9, 2017-11-01, Android ** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER (CVE-2017-13103) This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. The CVSS score below reflects a worst-case scenario of code execution as a system user, however many devices and vulnerabilities have significantly lower impacts and therefore lower CVSS scores.",
  "ID": "VU#787952",
  "IDNumber": "787952",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "The impacts are wide-ranging depending on the device, however a remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to at worst execute commands as a system user if a victim can be enticed to install a malicious app capable of exploiting the vulnerability. Affected users are encouraged to review the specific impacts in the paper from Kryptowire.",

  "Overview": "Android apps, including those pre-installed on some mobile devices, contain multiple vulnerabilities. All of these vulnerabilities were reported by Kryptowire. Vulnerabilities in pre-installed apps were presented at DEF CON 26 and a set of different vulnerabilities were previously coordinated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) and National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC).",
