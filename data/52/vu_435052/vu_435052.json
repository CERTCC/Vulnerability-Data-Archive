  "Resolution": "Update\nWhen possible, administrators are recommended to obtain updated software. See the systems affected section of this document for a partial list of affected vendors. In network architectures using NAT, fixing this issue may not be feasible. Administrators are encouraged to review the below workarounds. Administrators can determine if their proxy server is vulnerable by reading the \"Reproduction Instructions\" section of the Socket Capable Browser Plugins Result In Transparent Proxy Abuse paper.",

  "Workarounds": "Workarounds for Administrators It is possible to limit the impact of this vulnerability by restricting access in several ways. None of the below workarounds solve the issue, but they will significantly reduce the impact. Because an attacker can not access HTTP cookies, internal services that use an authentication scheme (such as a username/password) are not likely to be affected. Network designs that have limited connectivity between the proxy and internal services will prevent an attacker from obtaining direct access to these services via the proxy. Administrators should consider using access control lists or firewall rules to prevent direct connections between internal servers and proxy servers. Administrators should limit the CONNECT method to only the minimum required port range (usually 443/tcp). Limiting the range of ports a proxy server can communicate on will limit what resources an attacker can target. When possible, router or switch access control lists should be configured to prevent HTTP proxy servers using ports or protocols that they should not normally need access to. HTTP proxy servers do not usually need to communicate with well known ports other than 80/tcp and 443/tcp. Workarounds for users To exploit this issue an attacker needs to execute active content (Java, Flash, Silverlight, etc) in the context of a web browser. Mozilla Firefox users should consider using the NoScript plugin to whitelist sites that can execute dynamic content. See the Securing Your Web Browser document for more information about secure browser configurations. Workarounds for proxy server vendors Although these workarounds will not address the underlying issue, vendors who distribute HTTP proxy servers are encouraged to implement them to mitigate future vulnerabilities. In default configurations the proxy server should only be able to connect to a limited number of well known ports. The CONNECT method should only be allowed for traffic that uses destination port 443/tcp, unless the proxy is designed to act as a TCP tunnel on all ports."
