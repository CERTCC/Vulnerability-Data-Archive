Disable automatic update check CVE-2014-6261 can be mitigated by unchecking \"Check For Updates\" in the Zenoss Versions page in the web interface. Note that you can also manually check for updates in the web interface, which triggers the same actions, and is therefore also vulnerable. Instead, users should check the Zenoss website for new versions, rather than using the in-app check. To avoid CSRF exploitation, users should also use a separate browser (or profile) for Zenoss, that is not shared with any other browsing.",
