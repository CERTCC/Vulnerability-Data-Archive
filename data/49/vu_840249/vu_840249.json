  "Description": "An attacker with a known username and access to a service (telnet, rlogin or FTP) that uses the standard authentication API (loginDefaultEncrypt (), part of loginLib) can brute force the password in a relatively short period of time. Since the hashing algorithm is susceptible to collisions, the actual password does not have to be found, just a string that produces the same hash. For instance, when the default 'target/password' login example is used, 'y{{{{{kS' hashes to the same string as 'password'. It is thus possible to login using both 'password' and 'y{{{{{kS' as the passwords for the user 'target'. Additional information can be found in ICS-CERT advisory ICSA-10-214-01 and on the Metasploit Blog.",

  "Resolution": "Vendors which use VxWorks in their products should not use the default hashing algorithm in standard authentication API (loginDefaultEncrypt()). A trusted authentication API should be used instead. It can be installed by means of the loginEncryptInstall() loginLib hook. In addition, and so as to avoid registration of the default 'target'/'password' credentials at init time, the LOGIN_USER_NAME and LOGIN_USER_PASSWORD project parameters/#defines should be set to empty strings (so that no user is registered using the default encryption routine). Only after the new encryption routine is registered should new users be added to the system. loginEncryptInstall allows the user to install a custom encryption routine. The custom routine <rtn> must be of the following form: STATUS encryptRoutine char *password,               /* string to encrypt    */\n       char *encryptedPassword       /* resulting encryption */ The <encryptedPassword> string length should be no more than : + VxWorks 6.4 and below: 80 characters\n+ VxWorks 6.5 and above: 128 characters When a custom encryption routine is installed, a host version of this routine must be written to replace the tool vxencrypt in host/<hostOs>/bin. Appendix #1 shows example code making use of loginEncryptInstall() to set a custom encryption routine. Depending on the VxWorks version used, either SHA-512 or SHA-256 are used.
