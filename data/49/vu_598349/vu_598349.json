  "Description": "The Web Proxy Automatic Discovery (WPAD) protocol is used to automatically provide proxy configuration information to devices on a network. Clients issue a special DHCP request to obtain the information for the proxy configuration, but will fall back on a DNS request to one of several standardized URLs making use of the subdomain name of \u201cwpad\u201d if a DHCP response is unavailable. An attacker with local area network (LAN) access may be able to add a device with the name \u201cwpad\u201d to the network, which may produce a collision with a standardized WPAD DNS name. Many customer premise home/office routers (including, but not limited to, Google Wifi and Ubiquiti UniFi) automatically register device names as DNS A records on the LAN, which may allow an attacker to utilize a specially named and configured device to act as a WPAD proxy configuration server. The attacker-served proxy configuration can result in the loss of confidentiality and integrity of any network activity by any device that utilizes WPAD. Other autodiscovery names such as ISATAP may also be exploitable.",

  "Impact": "An attacker, with access to the network, could add a malicious device to the network with the name \"WPAD\". This attacker may be able to utilize DNS auto-registration and auto-discovery to act as a proxy for victims on the network, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and integrity of network activity.",

  "Overview": "Automatic DNS registration and autodiscovery functionality provides an opportunity for the misconfiguration of networks, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and integrity of the network if an attacker on the network adds a specially configured proxy device.",
