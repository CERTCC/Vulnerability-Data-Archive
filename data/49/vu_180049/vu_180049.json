  "Description": "Speculative execution is a technique used by many modern processors to improve performance by predicting which instructions may be executed based on past execution history. An attacker with local user access may be able to utilize sequences of speculative execution to perform a cache timing side-channel analysis. CWE-208: Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy CVE-2018-3639 \u2013 Speculative Store Bypass (SSB) \u2013 also known as \"Variant 4\" Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and speculative execution of memory reads before the addresses of all prior memory writes are known may read an earlier value of the data. Subsequent speculative memory accesses cause allocations into the cache, which may allow a sequence of speculative loads to be used to perform timing side-channel attacks. In particular, if an attacker has control of a previously cached value, or the first store and load instructions are accesses onto the stack, an attacker may be able to control future speculative execution and access arbitrary privileged data by using less privileged code with timing side-channel analysis. CVE-2018-3640 \u2013 Rogue System Register Read (RSRE) \u2013 also known as \"Variant 3a\" Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and that perform speculative reads of system registers may return a speculative register value that is then used in subsequent speculative load instructions. These subsequence speculative loads cause allocations into the cache that may allow a sequence of speculative loads to be used to perform timing side-channel attacks. An attacker with local user access may be able to use timing side-channel analysis to determine the values stored in system registers. For more information and technical details, please see the original Project Zero bug report, Intel's security advisory INTEL-SA-00115, AMD's whitepaper, and ARM's whitepaper. These vulnerabilities have been noted in the media for their similarity to previously-disclosed vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-5753 (Variant 1, \"Spectre\"), CVE-2017-5715 (Variant 2, \"Spectre\"), CVE-2017-5754 (Variant 3, \"Meltdown\").

  "Resolution": "Update system software Affected users should check with OEM and system software vendors and apply any available updates as soon as possible. Microcode updates and other system updates are expected to be available within the coming weeks. The Vendor Status links below provide further information. Update your browser Affected users should update to the latest version of any web browser in use. Most leading browser providers have recently deployed mitigations in their Managed Runtimes \u2013 mitigations that substantially increase the difficulty of exploiting side channels in a modern web browser. These techniques would likewise increase the difficulty of exploiting a side channel in a browser based on SSB.",
