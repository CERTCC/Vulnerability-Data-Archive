  "Description": "PrinterLogic versions up to and including 18.3.1.96 are vulnerable to multiple attacks. The PrinterLogic agent, running as SYSTEM, does not validate the PrinterLogic Management Portal's SSL certificate, validate PrinterLogic update packages, or sanitize web browser input. CVE-2018-5408: The PrinterLogic Print Management software does not validate, or incorrectly validates, the PrinterLogic management portal's SSL certificate. When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The software might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the software might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host. (CWE-295) CVE-2018-5409: PrinterLogic Print Management software updates and executes the code without sufficiently verifying the origin and integrity of the code. An attacker can execute malicious code by compromising the host server, performing DNS spoofing, or modifying the code in transit. (CWE-494) CVE-2019-9505: PrinterLogic Print Management software does not sanitize special characters allowing for remote unauthorized changes to configuration files. (CWE-159)",

    "CVE-2018-5408",
    "CVE-2018-5409",
    "CVE-2019-9505"
  ],
  "Overview": "PrinterLogic Print Management Software fails to validate SSL and software update certificates, which could allow an attacker to reconfigure the software and remotely execute code. In addition, the PrinterLogic agent does not sanitize browser input allowing a remote attacker to modify configuration settings. These vulnerabilities may result in a remote attacker executing code on workstations running the PrinterLogic agent.",
