  "Description": "ASLR is an exploit mitigation technique used by modern Windows platforms. For ASLR to function, Windows executables must contain a relocations table. Despite containing the \"Dynamic base\" PE header, which indicates ASLR compatibility, Windows executables produced by mingw-w64 have the relocations table stripped from them by default. This means that executables produced by mingw-w64 are vulnerable to return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks.",
  "ID": "VU#307144",
  "IDNumber": "307144",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Windows executables generated by mingw-w64 claim to be ASLR compatible, but are not. Vulnerabilities in such executables are more easily exploitable as a result.",
  "Keywords": [
    "ASLR",
    "resources table"
  ],
  "Overview": "mingw-w64 produces a executable Windows files without a relocations table by default, which breaks compatibility with ASLR.",

  "Resolution": "The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. Please consider the following workaround:",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Force mingw-w64 to retain the relocations table mingw-w64 can be coerced into producing an executable with the relocations table intact by adding the following line before the main function in a program's source code: __declspec(dllexport) This line will cause the following function to be exported. When generating an executable that exports a function name, mingw-w64 will not strip the relocations table."
