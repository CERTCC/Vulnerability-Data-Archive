  "Description": "OpenSSL Security Advisory [8 February 2011] OCSP stapling vulnerability in OpenSSL Incorrectly formatted ClientHello handshake messages could cause OpenSSL\nto parse past the end of the message. This issue applies to the following versions: 1) OpenSSL 0.9.8h through 0.9.8q\n  2) OpenSSL 1.0.0 through 1.0.0c The parsing function in question is already used on arbitary data so no\nadditional vulnerabilities are expected to be uncovered by this. However, an attacker may be able to cause a crash (denial of service) by\ntriggering invalid memory accesses. The results of the parse are only availible to the application using\nOpenSSL so do not directly cause an information leak. However, some\napplications may expose the contents of parsed OCSP extensions,\nspecifically an OCSP nonce extension. An attacker could use this to read\nthe contents of memory following the ClientHello. Users of OpenSSL should update to the OpenSSL 1.0.0d (or 0.9.8r) release,\nwhich contains a patch to correct this issue. If upgrading is not\nimmediately possible, the source code patch provided in this advisory\nshould be applied. Neel Mehta (Google) identified the vulnerability. Adam Langley and\nBodo Moeller (Google) prepared the fix. Which applications are affected Applications are only affected if they act as a server and call\nSSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_cb on the server's SSL_CTX. This includes\nApache httpd >= 2.3.3, if configured with \"SSLUseStapling On\".
