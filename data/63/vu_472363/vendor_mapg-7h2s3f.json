  "Addendum": "Openwall GNU/*/Linux does not officially support IPv6. We do not have IPv6 support enabled in our kernels by default (nor can the corresponding kernel module possibly get auto-loaded, which would be a concern on some other Linux systems - we also do not support module auto-loading). While it is probably possible to configure an Openwall GNU/*/Linux system with a custom kernel build such that it would be vulnerable, anyone doing so is acting on his/her own.",
