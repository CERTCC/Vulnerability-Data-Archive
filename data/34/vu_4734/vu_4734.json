  "Description": "Basically commands can be executed as root without providing\nany identification - some sites may be secure if _PATH_EXECPATH has\nnot been created.  This would be a recommended workaround in the\nshort term (i.e. remove _PATH_EXECPATH).  This hole exists in all\nversions of wu-ftpd up to and including 2.1f.\n\n\nOne of the features of the server is the SITE EXEC function.  This\nallows ftp sites to set up a special directory that has binaries\nthat the user can run from the ftp server.  Normally this is\ngrep or some other indexing program.  Access to the feature from\na ftp client is as follows:\n\nftp> quote site exec grep foo bar\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\nexecutable + parameters\n\nThe server checks to make sure that the server is not executing\na binary that is located outside of a specially isolated binary\ndirectory (default is ~ftp/bin/ftp-exec/).\n\nThe first bug is that the server does not strip off the path\nof the executable when there are no parameters.\n\nFor example:\nftp> quote site exec ../../../../../bin/foo bar\n\nThe server strips off the ../../../../../bin/ and instead\nexecutes \"/bin/ftp-exec/foo bar\"\n\nftp> quote site exec ../../../../../bin/foo\n\nThe server does not strip off the ../../../../../bin/ (like it\nshould) and executes \"/bin/ftp-exec/../../../../../bin/foo.\n\n*NOTE*  /bin == ~ftp/bin when logged in as anonymous.\n\nThe second bug is that the server does not check to make sure that\nthe user is logged in before executing a SITE EXEC.",

  "Workarounds": "The 2.2 version fixes this problem in two ways: 1. in src/ftpcmd.y, a modification is made to insure that the\nprepended path to the executable is stripped before it is\nexecuted. 2. in src/ftpcmd.y, a modification to the SITE EXEC to check\nthat the user is logged in. When attempting to use SITE\nEXEC before logging in, the server will respond with\n\"530 Please login with USER and PASS.\" Version 2.2 has been released today (4/1/94) and is available from\nwuarchive.wustl.edu in /packages/wuarchive-ftpd/wu-ftpd-2.2.shar\nand /packages/wuarchive-ftpd/wu-ftpd-2.2.tar. It is also available\nfrom fegmania.wustl.edu in /wuarchive-ftpd. Affected sites may choose to disable anonymous FTP service until\nthey have corrected this problem. Affected sites can correct this problem through one of the\nfollowing two procedures: A. A new version of ftpd has been released that provides new features\nand also fixes this security problem. Sites can obtain this new\nversion via anonymous FTP from wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4). The files are located in: Size      Checksum\n/packages/wuarchive-ftpd/wu-ftpd-2.2.shar      ?? /packages/wuarchive-ftpd/wu-ftpd-2.2.tar       ?? B.
