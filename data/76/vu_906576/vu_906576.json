  "Description": "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values - CVE-2015-2914 Securifi Almond and Almond 2015 use static source ports for all DNS queries originating from the local area network (LAN). Additionally, DNS queries originating from the Almond itself, such as those to resolve the name of the firmware update server, use predictable TXIDs that start at 0x0002 and increase incrementally. An attacker with the ability to spoof DNS responses can cause Almond LAN clients to contact incorrect or malicious hosts under the attacker's control. CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information Securifi uses HTTP by default for checking and transmitting firmware update information to Almond products. An attacker capable of conducting man-in-the-middle attacks can manipulate traffic to block updates or inject arbitrary files. Note that as of August 24, 2015, Securifi has changed its firmware upgrade servers to use HTTPS. CWE-255: Credentials Management - CVE-2015-2915 Securifi Almond uses a default password of admin for the admin account. A local area network attacker can gain privileged access to the web management interface or leverage default credentials in remote attacks such as cross-site request forgery. CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CVE-2015-2916 Securifi Almond and Almond 2015 contain a global cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request. Note that in combination with default credentials, an attacker can establish an active session as part of an attack and therefore would not require a victim to be logged in. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - CVE-2015-2917 The Securifi Almond and Almond 2015 web management interfaces do not enforce the same-origin policy in X-Frame-Options response headers. An attacker can conduct clickjacking attacks via a specially crafted web page. The CVSS score below applies to CVE-2015-2916.",

  "Resolution": "Apply an update Securifi has released firmware versions to address these vulnerabilities. Almond users should upgrade to AL1-R201EXP10-L304-W34 or later. Almond 2015 users should upgrade to AL2-R088M or later. Note that the firmware updates mitigate the CSRF and clickjacking vulnerabilities by disabling the web management interface. Users may still enable web management from the Almond touch screen controls, but doing so will render their devices vulnerable. The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem and recommends the following workaround.",
