  "Description": "Microsoft released a security bulletin on March 23, 2011, describing nine certificates for seven domains issued by Comodo to an attacker who obtained the username and password of a Comodo Trusted Partner in Southern Europe. http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2524375.mspx Additional information about this issue is also available from Comodo's web site: http://blogs.comodo.com/it-security/data-security/the-recent-ra-compromise/ This issue presents a security risk because even a reasonably cautious user could be deceived into trusting the bogus certificates, since they appear to be from the affected domains. Once accepted, these certificates may allow an attacker to intercept network traffic between the user and the affected domain. This problem is the result of a failure by the certificate authority to correctly authenticate the recipient of a certificate. Comodo has taken the appropriate action by revoking the certificates in question. However, this in itself is insufficient to prevent the malicious use of these certificates until a patch has been installed, because Internet Explorer does not check for such revocations automatically. Indeed, because the Certificates issued by Comodo do not contain any information regarding where to check for a revocation, Internet Explorer, or any browser, is unable to check for revocations of these certificates. Microsoft is developing an update that will enable revocation checking and install a revocation handler that compensates for the lack of information in the certificate.",

These certificates may be used to spoof content, perform phishing attacks, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks against all web browsers. Although users who try to connect to an affected website with these certificates would generally be presented with a warning dialog, there will not be any obvious reason to believe that the certificate is not authentic due to the fact that it has been signed but a trusted authority.",
