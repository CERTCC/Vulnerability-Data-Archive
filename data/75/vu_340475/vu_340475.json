  "ID": "VU#340475",
  "IDNumber": "340475",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "Devices communicating on networks without using TLS 1.3 risk man-in-the-middle attacks and being tracked across the Internet.",
  "Keywords": [
    "TLS",
    "privacy",
    "tracking",
    "client-certificates",
    "identifiers"
  ],
  "Overview": "TLS versions prior to 1.3 are vulnerable to attacks that would allow an attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks and identify and track individual devices across the Internet.",
  "References": "https://www.petsymposium.org/2018/files/papers/issue4/popets-2018-0031.pdf",
  "Resolution": "Fully implement TLS 1.3 on both client and server and refuse to do client authentication with servers that do not support TLS 1.3.",
  "Revision": 11,
  "SystemsAffectedPreamble": "iOS devices prior to iOS 11, a Mac OS X device prior to High Sierra or a Windows machine with any version of iTunes installed. In addition, the attacks also apply to all technologies that use TLS client Certificates for HTTPS authentication through a web browser, such as smart cards.",
  "ThanksAndCredit": "Thanks to Lucas Foppe; Jeremy Martin (MITRE); Travis Mayberry; Erick C. Rye; and Lamont Brown for reporting this vulnerability.",

  "VulnerabilityCount": 1,
  "Workarounds": "Modify browser settings to prevent client certificates from being sent unencrypted during a TLS handshake."
