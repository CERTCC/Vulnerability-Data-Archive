  "VendorStatement": "Please find all AVM security notifications here: https://en.avm.de/service/current-security-notifications/ The FRITZ!Box is not affected by this vulnerability. The recently announced FRITZ!Repeater 3000 is the only AVM product that already supports WPA3. The new WPA3 WiFi standard is not active in the repeater's factory settings. AVM has already released an update for the FRITZ!Repeater 3000 as a Lab version, which addresses the points of the current WPA3 vulnerability. AVM also recommends always choosing a really long, strong network password. The password evaluation in FRITZ!OS helps you find a strong password. AVM strongly recommends deploying the provided updates from manufacturers for all wireless clients, for example notebooks, smart TVs or tablets."
