  "VendorStatement": "Description of Problem: Wizz RSS News Reader version 2.1.7 (Including earlier versions) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits. A \"quick fix\" was applied to version 2. 1.8, but the fix was found to be very weak and, in most cases, ineffectual. The vulnerability allowed non-trusted scripts, injected into various RSS and Atom\n feeds, to execute within the trusted chrome space of the Firefox web browser. Problem Resolution: Wizz RSS News Reader version 2.1.9 includes a fix for the above mentioned cross-site scripting vulnerability. In version 2.1.9, all feeds are \"sanitized\" as\nthey are parsed. It is very highly recommended that ALL users of Wizz RSS News Reader upgrade to version 2.1.9, as soon as they possibly can. Version 2.1.9 can be installed from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/424 Credit: Many thanks to Jefferson Ogata of NOAA Computer Incident Response Team (N-CIRT) for his invaluable input with regard to reporting and evaluating the vulnerability. Also, many thanks to Jefferson Ogata for his valued advice on fixing the vulnerability, and for the time taken to produce proof of concept code.",
