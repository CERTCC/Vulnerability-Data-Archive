  "VendorStatement": "The vast majority of Technicolor products do not use Intel hardware. They remain therefore unaffected by CVE-2018-8897. For products which use Intel Puma 6&7 SoCs, this security vulnerability does not pose additional security risks because the software is essentially a single application with no privilege separation. Overall Technicolor products are unaffected by this vulnerability."
