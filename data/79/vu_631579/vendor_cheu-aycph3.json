  "Revision": 1,
  "Status": "Affected",
  "Vendor": "Xen",
  "VendorInformation": "For the full statement, please see Xen Advisory 260.",
  "VendorRecordID": "CHEU-AYCPH3",
  "VendorReferences": "https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-260.html",
  "VendorStatement": "All versions of Xen are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable.\u00a0 ARM systems are not vulnerable. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.\u00a0 x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability. An attacker needs to be able to control hardware debugging facilities to exploit the vulnerability, but such permissions are typically available to unprivileged users. MITIGATION Running only HVM or PVH guests avoids the vulnerability. Note however that a compromised device model (running in dom0 or a stub domain) can carry out this attack, so users with HVM domains are also advised to patch their systems. RESOLUTION Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue."
