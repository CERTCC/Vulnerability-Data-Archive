  "Resolution": "On June 11, 2002, Microsoft updated Microsoft Advisory (MS02-022) and released a new patch that remedies the vulnerability for users that downloaded and accepted the control. The previous solution did not fully protect against this action and  it was possible for an attacker to load the vulnerable control, even though the previous patch and updated versions had been installed. The new patch is available at http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=39632. All users should apply this patch, even if you previously installed an updated version of your software. This patch supercedes the patch information below. Microsoft has released a patch as an interim solution and upgrades to address this issue. If you have updated your software prior to June 11, 2002, you should reinstall the software from the following locations: Updated version of MSN Chat control Updated version of MSN Messenger with the corrected control Updated version of Exchange Instant Messenger with the corrected control Microsoft also suggests that the email attack vector is blocked by the following Microsoft mail products: Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 with the Outlook Email Security Update, Outlook 2002, and Outlook Express. All of these products will open HTML email in the Restricted Sites zone. Other mitigation strategies include opening web pages and email messages in the Restricted Sites zone and using email clients that permit users to view messages in plain-text. Likewise, it is important for users to realize that a signed control only authenticates the origin of the control and does not imply any information with regard to the security of the control. Therefore, downloading and installing signed controls through an automated process is not a secure choice.",
