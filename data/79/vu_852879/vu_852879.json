  "Impact": "The buffer overflow vulnerabilities in ntpd may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary malicious code with the privilege level of the ntpd process. The weak default key and non-cryptographic random number generator in ntp-keygen may allow an attacker to gain information regarding the integrity checking and authentication encryption schemes. More specifically, the weak default key allows access to private mode and control mode queries that require authentication, if not restricted by the configuration.",

  "Description": "The Network Time Protocol (NTP) provides networked systems and devices with a way to synchronize time for various services and applications. The reference implementation produced by the NTP Project (ntp.org) contains several vulnerabilities. CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing - CVE-2014-9298 The IPv6 address ::1 can be spoofed, allowing an attacker to bypass ACLs based on ::1. CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions - CVE-2014-9297 The length value in extension field pointers is not properly validated, allowing information leaks. CWE-332: Insufficient Entropy in PRNG - CVE-2014-9293 If no authentication key is defined in the ntp.conf file, a cryptographically-weak default key is generated. CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) - CVE-2014-9294 ntp-keygen before 4.2.7p230 uses a non-cryptographic random number generator with a weak seed to generate symmetric keys. CWE-121: Stack Buffer Overflow - CVE-2014-9295 A remote unauthenticated attacker may craft special packets that trigger buffer overflows in the ntpd functions crypto_recv() (when using autokey authentication), ctl_putdata(), and configure(). The resulting buffer overflows may be exploited to allow arbitrary malicious code to be executed with the privilege of the ntpd process. CWE-389: Error Conditions, Return Values, Status Codes - CVE-2014-9296 A section of code in ntpd handling a rare error is missing a return statement, therefore processing did not stop when the error was encountered. This situation may be exploitable by an attacker. The NTP Project provides more information about these issues in their security advisory. The NTP Project implementation is widely used in operating system distributions and network products. These vulnerabilities affect ntpd acting as a server or client. CERT/CC is not aware of any public exploit of these vulnerabilities at this time. The CVSS score below is based on the buffer overflow vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-9295).",
