  "VendorStatement": "\"All Insyde Secure Boot variables have always been protected from RUNTIME modifications. Insyde has reviewed the Insyde BIOS code and did find some vulnerabilities to some of the items in this report. Insyde suggested to OEM & ODM customers that they review all of their variables and protect any sensitive variables. By late 2014 Insyde had added a mechanism to assist in protecting variables. In addition, OEM & ODM customers were advised to remove RUNTIME access from as many variables as possible to meet their market requirements. By late 2014 Insyde had implemented protection of the Boot Mode. All of these updates were available in Tags 03.74.32 and 05.04.32 which was the 2014 work week 32 release. The internal tracking number was IB02960647. OEM and ODM customers are advised to contact their Insyde support representative for documentation and assistance. End users are advised to contact the manufacturer of their equipment.\"",
