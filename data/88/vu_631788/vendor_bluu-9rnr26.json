  "VendorStatement": "This class of vulnerabilities redirects SMM code to execute instructions \noutside SMRAM, and we often refer to them as \"SMM Call-Out Vulnerabilities\". Intel is not currently aware of SMM call-out vulnerabilities in our supported \nproducts. In addition, the following mitigation may be relevant to the \ndiscussion of these vulnerabilities. Starting in Haswell-based client and server platforms, the \"SMM Code Access \nCheck\" feature is available in the CPU. If SMM code enables this in the \nappropriate MSR, then logical processors are prevented from executing SMM code \noutside the ranges defined by the SMRR. If SMI code jumps outside these ranges, \nthe CPU will assert a machine check exception. During BIOS development, this \ncan be an effective mechanism for BIOS developers to identify insecure \ncall-outs from SMM, and during runtime, this feature can also be effective at \nblocking certain attacks that redirect SMM execution outside SMRAM.",
