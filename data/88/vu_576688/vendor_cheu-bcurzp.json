  "Vendor": "Okta Inc.",

  "VendorStatement": "This is not a vulnerability or defect in Okta\u2019s service or multi-factor \nauthentication (MFA) integration to Windows Server. Rather, this is an issue in \nhow Microsoft unlocks reconnected Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions \nwithout calling the credential provider. The Okta MFA Credential Provider does not currently support Windows 10 or \nWindows Server 2019. However, any organization that has chosen to use the Okta \nMFA Credential Provider for Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019 may be vulnerable \nto this Microsoft issue, and users may not be prompted for authentication or \nMFA upon re-establishing an RDP session. As of June 6, we are unaware of any official Microsoft fix, and advise our \ncustomers to reach out to Microsoft for next steps."
