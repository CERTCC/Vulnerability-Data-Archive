  "VendorStatement": "After investigating this scenario,\u00a0 Microsoft has determined that this scenario \nis using valid, cached credentials. It does not compromise security boundaries \nor bypass security features.\u00a0 Therefore it does not meet the Microsoft Security \nServicing Criteria for Windows.\u00a0 The RDP behavior change observed in VU#576688 \nwas introduced in Windows Server 2019.\u00a0The change allows the connection to \nproceed in the earliest phase of connection. As long as it is connected, the \nclient will cache the credentials used for connecting and reuse them when it \nneeds to auto-reconnect. As a best practice, Microsoft recommends that users always lock the client RDP \nand all computers when unattended."
