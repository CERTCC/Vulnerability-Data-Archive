  "Workarounds": "Disable SMBv3 compression According to Microsoft Security Advisory ADV200005 : You can disable compression to block unauthenticated attackers from exploiting the vulnerability against an SMBv3 Server with the PowerShell command below. Set-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanServer\\Parameters\" DisableCompression -Type DWORD -Value 1 -Force Notes: No reboot is needed after making the change. This workaround does not prevent exploitation of SMB clients. You can disable the workaround with the PowerShell command below. Set-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanServer\\Parameters\" DisableCompression -Type DWORD -Value 0 -Force Block inbound and outbound SMB Consider blocking outbound SMB connections (TCP port  445 for SMBv3) from the local network to the WAN. Also ensure that SMB connections from the internet are not allowed to connect inbound to an enterprise LAN."
