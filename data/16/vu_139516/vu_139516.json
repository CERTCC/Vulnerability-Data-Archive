  "Impact": "The complete impact of this vulnerability is not yet known. RISK ASSESSMENT Because the SNMP Public vulnerability is caused by default SNMP configuration within the ServerIron ADX software codes, potentially a large number of the affected devices are exposing SNMP to the public Internet. When exposed to the Internet, a remote attacker can retrieve various device configuration settings including authentication credentials. If the potential attackers are walking the MIB, they will potentially have access to the encrypted username and password. When they are successful in decrypting the hash password, they will have full access of the affected ServerIron ADX devices.",

  "Description": "PRODUCTS AFFECTED: ServerIron JetCore 10.2.02\nServerIron ADX 12.3.01\nServerIron ADX 12.4.0\nServerIron ADX 12.5.1 BULLETIN OVERVIEW The purpose of this bulletin is to provide information to regarding the recently discovered SNMP Public vulnerability within the affected ServerIron ADX software codes. The vulnerability is caused because the SNMP agent is enabled by default and the community string is set as \"public\" by default. This default behavior may lead to unwanted exploit of authentication data via the read only community string of \"public.\"  The Brocade's family of physical ADX devices that are using the listed affected software codes are vulnerable to this potential exploit. PROBLEM STATEMENT The affected ServerIron ADX software codes (10.2.02, 12.3.01, 12.4.0, and 12.5.1) are configured by default with the SNMP agent enabled and the SNMP community strings to be set to \"public.\"   When the default SNMP configuration within these affected ServerIron ADX software codes is unchanged, the client is vulnerable to potential exploits. The data could be extracted by gaining access to the read-only public SNMP community string, which enables outside access to the sensitive ServerIron ADX device information.",

  "Resolution": "We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. CORRECTED IN RELEASE: ServerIron JetCore 10.2.02g\nServerIron ADX 12.3.01n\nServerIron ADX 12.4.00p\nServerIron ADX 12.5.01d WORKAROUND We recommend the proper workaround based on these two qualifying use cases: 1) For those that are not using SNMP: *\tdisable SNMP using \"no snmp-server\" command if SNMP agent is not required\n2)For those that are using SNMP: *\tchange default community string using \"snmp-server community <string> ro\" CORRECTIVE ACTION Please see the workaround for immediate action to mitigate the vulnerability and prevent potential exploit from attackers. The SNMP vulnerability will be fixed through these subsequent patch releases in ServerIron ADX 12.4.00p, 12.5.01d, 12.3.01n, and ServerIron JetCore 10.2.02g",
