  "Addendum": "For you convenience, a copy of this advisory (at the time it was announced) is available here: -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Security Advisory: IOS HTTP authorization vulnerability Revision 1.0 - INTERIM For public release 2001 June 27 08:00 (UTC -0800) Summary When HTTP server is enabled and local authorization is used, it is\n   possible, under some circumstances, to bypass the authentication and\n   execute any command on the device. It that case, the user will be able\n   to exercise complete control over the device. All commands will be\n   executed with the highest privilege (level 15). All releases of Cisco IOS\u00ae software, starting with the release 11.3\n   and later, are vulnerable. Virtually, all mainstream Cisco routers and\n   switches running Cisco IOS are affected by this vulnerability. Products that are not running Cisco IOS software are not vulnerable. The workaround for this vulnerability is to disable HTTP server on the\n   router or to use Terminal Access Controller Access Control System\n   (TACACS+) or Radius for authentication. This advisory will be posted at\n   http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/IOS-httplevel-pub.html Affected Products Any device running Cisco IOS software, starting with the release 11.3\n   and later is vulnerable. Cisco devices that may be running with affected IOS software releases\n   include, but are not limited to: * Cisco routers in the AGS/MGS/CGS/AGS+, IGS, RSM, 800, ubr900,\n       1000, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 2500, 2600, 3000, 3600, 3800, 4000,\n       4500, 4700, AS5200, AS5300, AS5800, 6400, 7000, 7100, 7200,\n       ubr7200, 7500, and 12000 series. * Most recent versions of the LS1010 ATM switch. * The Catalyst 6000 if it is running Cisco IOS software. * The Catalyst 2900XL LAN switch only if it is running Cisco IOS\n       software. * The Catalyst 1900, 2800, 2900, 3000, and 5000 series LAN switches\n       are affected. * The Cisco Distributed Director. For some products, the affected software releases are relatively new\n   and may not be available on every device listed above. If you are not running Cisco IOS software, you are not affected by\n   this vulnerability. Cisco products that do not run Cisco IOS software and are not affected\n   by this defect include, but are not limited to: * 700 series dialup routers (750, 760, and 770 series). * The Catalyst 6000 is not affected if it is not running Cisco IOS\n       software. * WAN switching products in the IGX and BPX lines. * The MGX (formerly known as the AXIS shelf). * Host-based software. * The Cisco PIX Firewall. * The Cisco LocalDirector. * The Cisco Cache Engine. No other Cisco products are affected. Details By sending a crafted URL it is possible to bypass authentication and\n   execute any command on the router at level 15 (enable level, the most\n   privileged level). This will happen only if the user is using a local\n   database for authentication (usernames and passwords are defined on\n   the device itself). The same URL will not be effective against every\n   Cisco IOS software release and hardware combination. However, there\n   are only 84 different combinations to try, so it would be easy for an\n   attacker to test them all in a short period of time. The URL in question folows this format: http://<device_addres>/level/xx/exec/.... Where xx is a number between 16 and 99. This vulnerability is documented as Cisco Bug ID CSCdt93862. Impact An attacker can exercise complete control over the device. By\n   exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can see and change\n   configuration of the device. Software Versions and Fixes Each row of the table describes a release train and the platforms or\n   products for which it is intended. If a given release train is\n   vulnerable, then the earliest possible releases that contain the fix\n   and the anticipated date of availability for each are listed in the\n   \"Rebuild\", \"Interim\", and \"Maintenance\" columns. A device running any\n   release in the given train that is earlier than the release in a\n   specific column (less than the earliest fixed release) is known to be\n   vulnerable, and it should be upgraded at least to the indicated\n   release or a later version (greater than the earliest fixed release\n   label). When selecting a release, keep in mind the following definitions: Maintenance\n                Most heavily tested and highly recommended release of any\n                label in a given row of the table. Rebuild\n                Constructed from the previous maintenance or major\n                release in the same train, it contains the fix for a\n                specific defect. Although it receives less testing, it\n                contains only the minimal changes necessary to effect the\n                repair. Interim\n                Built at regular intervals between maintenance releases\n                and receives less testing. Interims should be selected\n                only if there is no other suitable release that addresses\n                the vulnerability, and interim images should be upgraded\n                to the next available maintenance release as soon as\n                possible. Interim releases are not available via\n                manufacturing, and usually they are not available for\n                customer download from CCO without prior arrangement with\n                the Cisco TAC. In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the\n   devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current\n   hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported\n   properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact\n   the Cisco TAC for assistance as shown in the following section.
