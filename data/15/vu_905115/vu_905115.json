  "Description": "CVE-2019-11477: SACK Panic (Linux >= 2.6.29). A sequence of specifically crafted selective acknowledgements (SACK) may trigger an integer overflow, leading to a denial of service or possible kernel failure (panic). CVE-2019-11478: SACK Slowness (Linux < 4.15) or Excess Resource Usage (all Linux versions). A sequence of specifically crafted selective acknowledgements (SACK) may cause a fragmented TCP queue, with a potential result in slowness or denial of service. CVE-2019-5599: SACK Slowness (FreeBSD 12 using the RACK TCP Stack). The TCP loss detection algorithm, Recent ACKnowledgment (RACK), uses time and packet or sequence counts to detect losses. RACK uses linked lists to track and identify missing packets. A sequence of specifically crafted acknowledgements may cause the linked lists to grow very large, thus consuming CPU or network resources, resulting in slowness or denial of service. CVE-2019-11479: Excess Resource Consumption Due to Low MSS Values (all Linux versions). The default maximum segment size (MSS) is hard-coded to 48 bytes which may cause an increase of fragmented packets. This vulnerability may create a resource consumption problem in both the CPU and network interface, resulting in slowness or denial of service.
