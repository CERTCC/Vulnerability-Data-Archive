  "Description": "as described in an ISS alert.... note that the whole advisory was included for copyright reasons. There are descriptions of other vulnerabilities here to. Please only pay attention to the \"SGI-schemebo\" section.\n\nISS Security Alert Summary\nSeptember 24, 1997\nVolume 1 Number 3\n \n \nTo receive these Alert Summaries, subscribe to the ISS Alert mailing list\nby sending an email to majordomo@iss.net and within the body of the\nmessage type:  'subscribe alert'.\n \n---\n5 Reported New Vulnerabilities \n - SGI-schemebo\n - rdist-bo3\n - Sun-libX11bo\n - OpenBSD-iosig\n - SGI-lockout\n \n---\nDate Reported:          9/15/97\nVulnerability:          SGI-schemebo\nAffected Platforms:     IRIX (5.0.x, 5.1.x, 5.2, 5.3, 6.0.x,\n                              6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4)\nRisk Factor:            High\n \nSGI uses /usr/lib/iaf/scheme as its login program which allows arguments\nto be passed to it.  An attacker can send a set of arguments that can\nresult in a buffer overflow condition.  Arbitrary commands can be executed\nas a result of this vulnerability as a privileged account.\n \nReferences:\nftp://sgigate.sgi.com/security/19970508-02-PX\nhttp://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/bulletins/h-106.shtml\n \n \n---\nDate Reported:          9/16/97\nVulnerability:          rdist-bo3\nAffected Platforms:     AIX (3.2, 4.1, 4.2)\n                        FreeBSD (2.1.0)\n                        Solaris (currently producting patches)\n                        SunOS (currently producing patches)\nRisk Factor:            High\n \nA buffer overflow problem has been found in set-uid 'root' versions of\nrdist.  It is possible to make rdist execute user created code as 'root'\nwhich results in the execution of arbitrary commands such as /usr/bin/csh.\n \nReferences:\nftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-97.23.rdist\nhttp://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/bulletins/h-107.shtml\n \n \n---\nDate Reported:          9/17/97\nVulnerability:          Sun-libX11bo\nAffected Platforms:     SunOS (4.1.3, 4.1.4)\n                        Solaris (2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1)\nRisk Factor:            High\n \nThe X Windows system library, libX11, contains several buffer overflows\nthat may be exploited through setuid and setgid programs that link libX11.\nThese exploits can lead to increased access including the 'root' user\naccount.\n \nReferences:\nhttp://sunsolve.sun.com/sunsolve/secbulletins/security-alert-154.txt\nhttp://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/bulletins/h-108.shtml\n \n \n---\nDate Reported:          9/15/97\nVulnerability:          OpenBSD-iosig\nAffected Platforms:     BSD (4.4 based)\n                            - BSDI\n                            - NetBSD\n                            - OpenBSD\n                            - FreeBSD\nRisk Factor:            Medium\n \nOpenBSD (as well as other 4.4BSD kernel based operating systems)\ncontains\na vulnerability in the way it handles certain i/o signals.  This bug\nallows unprivileged users to send signals to arbitrary processes of\nprograms on the system and inturrupt its operation, or even kill the\nprocess all together.\n \nReference:\nhttp://www.cdc.net/~x/advisories/open-iosig.asc\n                        \n                        \n---\nDate Reported:          9/15/97\nVulnerability:          SGI-lockout\nAffected Platforms:     IRIX (5.0.x, 5.1.x, 5.2, 5.3, 6.0.x,\n                              6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4)\nRisk Factor:            Low\n \nA vulnerability exists in IRIX's login program.  LOCKOUT is used to\nlock out accounts when a given number of unsuccessful login attempts\nhas been reached.  When the LOCKOUT value is set to a value greater than\nzero, files can be created or corrupted.\n                            \nReferences:\nftp://sgigate.sgi.com/security/19970508-02-PX\nhttp://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/bulletins/h-106.shtml\n \n \n---\nRisk Factor Key:\n \n        High    any vulnerability that provides an attacker with immediate\n                access into a machine, gains superuser access, or bypasses\n                a firewall.  Example:  A vulnerable Sendmail 8.6.5 version\n                that allows an intruder to execute commands on mail\n                server.\n        Medium  any vulnerability that provides information that has a\n                high potential of giving access to an intruder.  Example: \n                A misconfigured TFTP or vulnerable NIS server that allows\n                an intruder to get the password file that possibly can\n                contain an account with a guessable password.\n        Low     any vulnerability that provides information that\n                potentially could lead to a compromise.  Example:  A\n                finger that allows an intruder to find out who is online\n                and potential accounts to attempt to crack passwords\n                via bruteforce.\n \n \nInternet Security Systems, Inc., (ISS) is the pioneer and world's leading\nsupplier of network security assessment and monitoring tools,  providing   \ncomprehensive software that enables organizations to proactively manage   \nand minimize their network security risks.
