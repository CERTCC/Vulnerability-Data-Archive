  "VendorStatement": "- Virtuozzo 6 (formerly Parallels Cloud Server 6) Virtual Machines are\nnot affected since our hypervisor does not utilize page sharing. - Virtuozzo 6 Containers are affected through \"pfcache\" feature (enabled\nby default), in the sense that from inside a Container you can find out\nwhether any other container on the host has (or ever had) the particular\napplication/file (of the particular version). We are considering this\ninformation leak a minor issue, which comes as a price for memory\ndeduplication. We have no plans for fixing it. If this is considered a\nmajor threat by user, then it could be mitigated by disabling the\n\"pfcache\" functionality.",
