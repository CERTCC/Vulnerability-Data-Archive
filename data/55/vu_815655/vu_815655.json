  "Description": "An attacker can gain physical access to the communications bus between the host computer and the Bunch Note Acceptor (BNA) and may be able to commit deposit forgery or update the bill validator software with arbitrary programs. CVE-2020-10124\u00a0 \nNCR SelfServ 6632 (or ATMs of the same manufacturer with the same set of software) running APTRA XFS 05.01.00, are vulnerable to deposit forgery because the bus or communication channel between the host computer and the BNA (Bunch Note Acceptor) is not encrypted. Utilizing physical access to the ATM/BNA communications during a cash deposit, an attacker may intercept and alter the number and value of the bills being deposited. Serial control commands are utilized to communicate between the host computer and BNA. (CWE-311) Once changes are accepted by the host computer, the attacker could go to any ATM and withdraw more money than what was actually deposited. CVE-2020-10125\u00a0 \nNCR SelfServ 6632 (or ATMs of the same manufacturer with the same set of software) running APTRA XFS 04.02.01 and 05.01.00 uses 512-bit RSA certificates with a long expiration date to validate BNA software updates. With a 512-RSA key, the key pair may be broken in a short period of time. An attacker could utilize the key to sign arbitrary files and CAB archives used to update BNA software. The key could also enable an attacker to bypass application white-listing, executing arbitrary code. (CWE-326) CVE-2020-10126\nNCR SelfServ 6632 (or ATMs of the same manufacturer with the same set of software) running APTRA XFS 05.01.00 are vulnerable to malicious code updates. The update process for the BNA's bill validator is vulnerable to an attacker with a crafted CAB file containing a specific file, which could bypass the digital signature check, resulting in the execution of arbitrary software with SYSTEM privileges. With physical access and a USB or CD containing a crafted CAB; the attacker could restart the ATM. The ATM restart would trigger the update process and run malicious code. (CWE-345)",

  "IDNumber": "815655",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "The communications between the computer and the BNA is not encrypted, which allows for deposit forgery. The attacker could withdraw an increased amount of money. RSA-512 certificates have inadequate encryption strength. An attacker could run arbitrary software attacking the BNA and obtain cash.",

  "Overview": "NCR SelfServ 6632 ATMs may be vulnerable to physical attacks on the communications bus between the host computer, and the BNA allowing an attacker to commit deposit forgery. Older NCR ATM software updates used 512-bit RSA certificates to validate BNA software updates. In addition, the update process may be vulnerable to physical attacks and may result in an attacker running arbitrary programs with SYSTEM privileges.",

  "Resolution": "Update to APTRA XFS 06.07 will include BNA2 and BNA3 platform components, enforcing encrypted communications between the host computer and BNA. The update to APTRA XFS 06.08  increases the strength of the RSA certificates to limit the window of opportunity for an attacker to break and misuse the certificate. This update will provide validation processes enforcement and protect from the bypass of a digital signature check. Update to APTRA XFS 06.08 is  cumulative and contains updates for all 3 CVEs.",
