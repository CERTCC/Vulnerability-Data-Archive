  "Status": "Affected",
  "Vendor": "NCR Corporation",
  "VendorInformation": "We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.",
  "VendorRecordID": "LTYS-BJ2PMB",
  "VendorReferences": "https://www.ncr.com/content/dam/ncrcom/content-type/documents/NCR_Security_Alert-2018-13_APTRA_XFS_v5.pdf",
  "VendorStatement": "NCR advises all of our customers that it is critically important that APTRA XFS software is kept up to date to ensure that the latest security patches are always installed. We note that the version of software referenced in this report, APTRA XFS 05.01 was released in 2010, and discontinued for support in 2015. Any customer still using unsupported software should upgrade at the earliest possible opportunity. NCR would also note that deposit fraud which might be achievable by exploiting the functionality described in these CVEs does not necessarily result in cash loss. Any Financial Institution that accepts automated deposits has \u2018know your customer\u2019 and other fraud mitigation policies in place which limit immediate funds availability. Such mitigations are typically stronger where foreign deposits are accepted, if at all. This form of electronic deposit fraud is unlikely to result in significant loss."
