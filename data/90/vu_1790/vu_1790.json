  "Impact": "A moderately sophisticated programmer with appropriate knowledge can set up\nan unauthorized PPP connection to any system that is running vulnerable\nsoftware, and that depends on CHAP for authentication. To gain this\nunauthorized access, an attacker must have the following: * Knowledge of the details of this vulnerability * Access to modifiable code (generally meaning source code) for a\nPPP/CHAP implementation, and sufficient programming skill to make\nsimple changes to that code. Note that such source code is widely\navailable on the Internet. * A modest amount of information about the configuration of the network\nto be attacked, including such things as usernames and IP addresses.",

  "Description": "A serious security vulnerability (bug ID CSCdi91594) exists in PPP CHAP\nauthentication in all \"classic\" Cisco IOS software versions (the software\nused on Cisco non-switch products with product numbers greater than or equal\nto 1000, on the AGS/AGS+/CGS/MGS, and on the CS-500, but not on Catalyst\nswitches or on 7xx or 9xx routers) starting with the introduction of CHAP\nsupport in release 9.1(1). The vulnerability permits attackers with\nappropriate skills and knowledge to completely circumvent CHAP\nauthentication. Other PPP authentication methods are not affected.\n\nA related vulnerability exists in Cisco IOS/700 software (the software used\non 7xx routers). A configuration workaround exists for IOS/700, and a\ncomplete fix for 76x and 77x routers will be included in software version\n4.1(2), due to be released by December, 1997. A fix for 75x routers is\nscheduled for the first half of 1998.",

Workarounds - Classic IOS Cisco knows of no generally usable workarounds for the classic IOS\nvulnerability. Affected users who wish to protect themselves must upgrade\ntheir software or stop using CHAP authentication. Alternatives to CHAP\nauthentication include PAP authentication and reliance on \"Caller ID\"\ninformation. The security differences between these methods are complex and\nsituation dependent, and are beyond the scope of this document. Workarounds - IOS/700 The IOS/700 vulnerability may be avoided by making any of the following\nconfiguration changes: * Prevent the routers in question from receiving any incoming calls,\nperhaps by changing the ISDN switch configuration, or by relying on\ncaller ID and using the \"set callerid\" and \"set callidreceive\" commands * Prevent routers that receive calls from authenticating themselves to\nthe calling systems using CHAP. You can effectively do this by using\nthe \"set ppp secret client\" command to set the CHAP secret that would\nbe used for such authentication to some randomly chosen \"garbage\"\nvalue. * Configure the routers such that different CHAP secrets are used in each\ndirection on each link. You can do this using the \"set ppp secret\nclient\" and \"set ppp secret host\" commands. Note that this method\ncannot be used on 7xx routers that need to communicate with classic IOS\nrouters, since classic IOS does not support asymmetric CHAP secrets. Any one of these changes should be sufficient. The changes may be removed\nafter the release and installation of IOS/700 software version 4.1(2).",
