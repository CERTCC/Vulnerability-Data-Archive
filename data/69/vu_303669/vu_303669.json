  "Description": "SolarWinds Orion is using a version of Angular, 1.5.11. Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform which has a vulnerability that can be used to escape the sandbox and execute javascript. Angular, 1.5.11 CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\nThe software constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment. Angular version 1.5.11 fails to maintain a sandbox environment, allowing the attacker to brake out of the sandbox and execute arbitrary JavaScript.",
