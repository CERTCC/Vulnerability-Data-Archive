  "Workarounds": "Restrict access to QuickTime Movies Until updates can be applied, the following workarounds may mitigate this vulnerability. Some web sites may allow anonymous users to upload QuickTime movies that exploit this vulnerability. Workarounds for users Mozilla has released Firefox 2.0.0.7 which may prevent exploitation of this vulnerability by removing Firefox's ability to run arbitrary scripts which are provided by command line arguments. Users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. Using the NoScript Firefox extension to whitelist web sites that can run scripts and access installed plugins will mitigate this vulnerability. See the NoScript FAQ for more information. Running Firefox with a limited user account may prevent an attacker from accessing or overwriting files that the limited user account does not have write access to. Workarounds for administrators Proxy servers or intrusion prevention systems may be able to filter QuickTime files and partially mitigate this vulnerability. Note that this workaround is not likely to mitigate or stop all attack vectors.",
