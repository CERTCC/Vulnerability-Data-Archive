  "Impact": "Dell's and Quantum's advisories state the following: An attacker with access to the remote user interface, or logviewer.htm URL, can execute shell commands and store and retrieve files on/from certain but not all directory locations of the tape library controller's flash file system. The vulnerable function is part of a conditional path in the main function of the \"logViewer.htm\" file. This file is used normally to view the various log files on the system and includes the ability to email log files to a supplied email address. This exploit can be issued without logging into the machine giving a remote attacker the ability of unauthenticated code execution.",

  "Description": "CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') Dell's and Quantum's advisories state the following: The tape library's remote user interface \"logViewer.htm\" page can be exploited by a remote attacker's pre-authentication and result in library firmware shell access and code execution. A conditional path in the main function of the \"logViewer.htm\" file, normally used to view supported system log files, could be exploited such that a remote attacker could request unauthenticated code execution without proper login. Due to the logViewer html page accepting POST requests that identified the path to a log file intended to be viewed or  e-mailed and such parameter data being used directly in shell commands to prepare the viewing or e-mail send operation, a specific manipulation of such POST request could result in command execution at the user level of the web server. Higher privilege level commands cannot be executed since the web server is not started at root level and therefore elevated privileges cannot be exploited except for a few commands that are granted via sudo file access. However, it is possible to exploit the shell connection and gain admin access to the web console by monitoring the '/tmp/' directory of the embedded system as the web portal stores its session data in the /tmp/ directory and an attacker monitoring such directory until an administrator logged in could copy the session data to gain admin access.",
