  "Resolution": "Upgrade Intel drivers\nIntel has released updates to address this issue. The Intel support site also provides a tool to assist users in determining the model and version of the wireless adapter they are using. Public reports indicate there may be compatibility issues when installing the new drivers. Known issues with the new drivers are documented in the driver release notes. Users should consult the release notes specific to their driver before applying updates. Users are encouraged to consult their OEM and hardware providers to determine the best way to update drivers. From Intel: It is recommended that you obtain and use the software provided via your laptop manufacturer. Intel\u00ae is a supplier of laptop components and does not manufacture or sell complete laptop systems. The software provided by Intel ... is a generic version. Each laptop computer original equipment manufacturer (OEM) may have altered the features, incorporated customizations, or made other changes to the software or software packaging they provide. The software provided has not been verified by your laptop manufacturer as to compatibility or other operation.
