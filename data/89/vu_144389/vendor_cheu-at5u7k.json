  "Vendor": "Legion of the Bouncy Castle",
  "VendorInformation": "CVE-2017-13098 was assigned to BouncyCastle.",
  "VendorRecordID": "CHEU-AT5U7K",
  "VendorReferences": "https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/commit/a00b684465b38d722ca9a3543b8af8568e6bad5c",
  "VendorStatement": "BouncyCastle TLS servers, when configured to use the JCE (Java\nCryptography Extension) for cryptographic functions, contained a weak\nBleichenbacher oracle when any TLS cipher suite using RSA key exchange\nwas negotiated. This specifically includes servers using the BCJSSE\nprovider in its default configuration. Affected software: bctls-fips-1.0.2.jar and earlier versions\nbctls-jdk15on-1.58.jar and earlier versions Note that the older TLS implementation (in the\norg.bouncycastle.crypto.tls package) is not vulnerable. For FIPS users, the issue is fixed in\nbctls-fips-1.0.3.jar We recommend all FIPS users upgrade as soon as possible. For the regular API, version 1.59 containing the fix is expected to be\navailable before the end of 2017. In the meantime, beta versions\nbeginning with 1.59b09 contain the fix, and are available from\nhttps://downloads.bouncycastle.org/betas/ . We recommend users upgrade\nimmediately to\nbctls-jdk15on-159b09.jar and then upgrade to the full 1.59 release as soon as it is available. If\ncontinuing to deploy vulnerable versions, we strongly recommend\ndisabling TLS cipher suites that use RSA key exchange."
