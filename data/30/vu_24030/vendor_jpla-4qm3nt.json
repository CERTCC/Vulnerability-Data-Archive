  "VendorStatement": "We do not distribute any \"default\" binaries which uses Kerberos. In order to get Kerberos support, you must rebuild the software specifically to use Kerberos (the default build will not use Kerberos). We believe that the University of Washington IMAP and POP3 servers are not vulnerable. The message from MIT specifically stated that the problem was in the Kerberos 4 routines from MIT. Kerberos support in these servers is based upon Kerberos 5, not Kerberos 4. UW imapd/ipop3d only uses GSSAPI and Kerberos 5 calls; Kerberos 4 routines are never called. There is an unsupported, contributed code, module for Kerberos 4 available in our software, but that is client only. We are not aware of the existence of any Kerberos 4 server code for UW imapd/ipop3d.",
