  "VendorInformation": "We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.", 
  "VendorStatement": "Yesterday we released an update update to our software (Easy-Hide-IP VPN 3.0.2) that includes an updated version of Komodia WITHOUT the SSL component. The SSL component was used in Easy-Hide-IP Classic 5.0.0.3 to filter prvacy risks but is no longer included in the latest version application. Existing Easy-Hide-IP users are now being migrated to the combined VPN/Classic client and the old client is being retired. The Komodia team have assured us that this version is 100% clear of any SSL modification. Please let us know if you have any questions or comments.",
