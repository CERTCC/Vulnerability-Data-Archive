BULLETIN  OVERVIEW\nA security vulnerability, US-CERT Ref VU#229804, has been identified in the OSPF protocol. This \nvulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.3 and is documented in the National Vulnerability Database as \nCVE-2013-0149. See http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm for details. Brocade produces and publishes Technical Support Bulletins to OEMs, partners and customers that \nhave a direct, entitled, support relationship in place with Brocade Please contact your primary service provider for further information regarding this topic and \napplicability for your environment. PROBLEM STATEMENT\nA security vulnerability, US-CERT Ref VU#229804, has been identified in the OSPF protocol. This \nvulnerability requires that the attacker already controls a router within the AS. RISK ASSESSMENT\nThe listed products are exposed to this vulnerability in the OSPF protocol, where the attacker already \nhas control of a router in the AS. This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.3. SYMPTOMS\nAn attacker who has gained control of a router within a given AS can arbitrarily poison the routing \ntables of all other routers in the AS. This can facilitate traffic subversion, black hole, etc. The attacker can cause attacks through a crafted illegal OSPF router LSA (type-1); where the link state \nID & router ID in the LSA is not same; leading to corruption of routing table in the routers. The crafted Router LSA must come from a source IP of an OSPF peer; in other words, spoofing a \nlegitimate OSPF peer. OR the router LSA is sent in the interface where an OSPF peer is existing \nalready. WORKAROUND\nThere is no workaround. However if users can physically secure their network/routers, the chance of \nthis attack is quite low. The recommendations are: a)  Physically secure the access to network routers, and links between routers. b)  Only allow passive OSPF protocols on interfaces with user/host connections, (i.e. leaf \ninterfaces). c)  Enable OSPF MD5 authentication \nThis is not considered completely secure, but it should make the attack more difficult. CORRECTIVE ACTION\nSee http://My.Brocade.com  for the appropriate SW release(s) as listed below, please contact your \naccount team or Brocade Support if you have further questions.
