  "Status": "Not Affected",
  "Vendor": "Technicolor",
  "VendorInformation": "We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.",
  "VendorRecordID": "TNOY-AUTNXZ",
  "VendorReferences": "None",
  "VendorStatement": "Both Spectre and Meltdown attacks presupposed \u201copen platforms\u201d, where \nadditional code can be added by a non-privileged user. The Technicolor products \nare not open platforms. Even where 3rd party application can run in containers \nand can be managed via Life Cycle Management, these applications are validated \nand signed before they can be installed on the platform. Technicolor is \ncurrently working with its vendors to identify if additional layers of \nprotection are needed. Yet, as the current platforms are closed and have secure \nbootloading mechanism in place, there is no risk and no privilege acquired by \nan attacker in exploiting such an attack on Technicolor's devices."
