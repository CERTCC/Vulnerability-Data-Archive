  "VendorStatement": "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Field Notice: Cisco PIX Firewall Manager File Exposure Revision 1.0\nFor release 10:00 AM US/Pacific, Wednesday, September 2, 1998\nCisco internal use only until release date. Summary The Cisco PIX Firewall product is shipped with a management application\nknown as PIX Firewall Manager,  or PFM. PFM is a Worldwide-Web-based\napplication, and includes a limited HTTP server. The PFM HTTP server runs on\nWindows NT computers. A vulnerability in the PFM HTTP server allows any\nattacker who can connect to the server to retrieve any file known in advance\nto exist on the Windows NT host. In almost all cases, this means that the\nhost is vulnerable to attack by any user inside the firewall, but not by\nusers outside the firewall. This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Brett M. Oliphant, Manager\nof Corporate Computer Security at Lafayette Life Insurance Company. Who Is Affected If you are running Cisco PIX Firewall Manager software for Windows NT, as\nshipped with PIX Firewall versions up to and including 4.2(1), and if\nuntrusted users can make TCP connections to port 8080 on your PFM server,\nyou are affected by this vulnerability. No other Cisco products are\naffected. Impact To exploit this vulnerability, attackers must be able to make TCP\nconnections to port 8080 on the NT host on which you have installed PFM. In\nall recommended configurations and in the overwhelming majority of actual\ninstallations, port 8080 of the PFM host can be reached only from inside the\nPIX Firewall, not from the outside. In addition, attackers must know or discover the names and locations of the\nfiles they wish to read. This vulnerability does not permit \"browsing\" of\nthe NT host or reading of directories; attackers must know where the target\nfile is, or must make repeated attempts at guessing the location until the\ntarget file is found. If they can meet these prerequisites, attackers can retrieve any file or\nfiles on the NT host on which PFM is installed, as well as any file or files\non network servers accessible through that host's file system. All files\nreadable to the \"administrator\" account are affected. In most cases, this\nincludes all files on the local disk, and many or most  files on\nnetwork-mounted volumes. In addition to obtaining confidential information\ndirectly, attackers may be able to use information obtained from the\nretrieved files to help them to conduct other attacks against the NT host. This vulnerability can be exploited using ordinary tools available on most\nnetworked computer systems. There is no need for a special exploitation\nprogram, nor is there a need for any unusual technical skill. Although Cisco\nwill not release further details of how to exploit this vulnerability, we\nbelieve that they could quickly be guessed at, based on the contents of this\nadvisory alone, by any person minimally sophisticated in such matters, and\nwe anticipate that other parties will publish these details shortly after\nthe release of this notice. Details This vulnerability has been assigned Cisco Bug ID CSCdk39378. Affected and Repaired Software Versions This vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco PIX Firewall Manager up to,\nand including, release 4.2(1). 4.2(2) beta releases are also affected. Fixed\nversions are available for both 4.1-based and 4.2-based versions of PFM. The fixed version for 4.1 is 4.1( 6b). To use PFM version 4.1(6b), you must\ninstall software version 4.1(6) on the PIX Firewall itself. The fixed version for 4.2 is 4.2(2), which will be released along with\n4.2(2) software for the PIX Firewall itself. 4.2(1) PIX Firewall software is\nunder line stop because of software quality issues, and is not recommended\nfor use or installation. Therefore, there will be no PFM fix for 4.2(1) PIX\nFirewall software. Customers who are using 4.2(1) are advised to downgrade\nto version 4.1(6) on their PIX Firewalls, and to install PFM 4.1(6b). If\nthis is not possible, customers should use the workarounds listed below. All releases subsequent to these repaired releases will also include the\nfix. There will be no future vulnerable PFM releases. Getting Fixed Software Cisco is offering free software upgrades for this problem to all customers\nwho are using PFM, regardless of contract status. This free upgrade program\nincludes both PFM version 4.1(6b) and, if necessary, the corresponding PIX\nFirewall software version 4.1(6). If you have a service contract, please download the new software from\nCisco's Worldwide Web site at http://www.cisco.com. If you do not have a\nservice contract, please call the Cisco TAC at one of the telephone numbers\nlisted in the \"Cisco Security Procedures\" section of this notice. Give the\nURL of this notice as evidence of your entitlement to an upgrade. Workarounds Because a software fix is available, Cisco believes that the best response\nfor the vast majority of customers is to upgrade to repaired software. These\nworkarounds are offered only for customers who are unable to upgrade for\nunusual reasons. We believe that many customers have installed the PIX Firewall Manager\nproduct on their NT workstations, but have finalized their PIX Firewall\nconfigurations and are no longer actively using PFM. The most effective\nworkaround for these customers is simply to uninstall PFM, and to reinstall\na repaired version later if necessary. Another possible workaround is to use firewall devices, such as the PIX\nFirewall itself, to prevent untrusted users from making connections to port\n8080 on the NT host on which PFM in installed. Depending on the customer\nconfiguration, it may be desirable to move the NT host to the PIX Firewall's\nDMZ network to prevent access by unauthorized inside users; the security of\nthe other systems on the DMZ network should be carefully considered in\nmaking this decision. It is not possible to stop the PFM HTTP server from using the NT\n\"administrator\" account. Exploitation and Public Announcements Cisco has had no reports of malicious exploitation of this vulnerability. However, such exploitation may reasonably be expected to begin in the near\nfuture. The existence of this vulnerability was publicly announced on the\n\"bugtraq@netspace.org\" mailing list on Monday, August 31, 1998, and should\nbe considered to be widely known to exist. Exploitation details were not\ngiven. Status of This Notice This is a final field notice.
