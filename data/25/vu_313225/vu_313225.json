  "Workarounds": "Disable the QuickTime ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer The vulnerable QuickTime ActiveX controls can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs: {02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B} {4063BE15-3B08-470D-A0D5-B37161CFFD69} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797. Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for these controls: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{4063BE15-3B08-470D-A0D5-B37161CFFD69}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 Disable the QuickTime plugin for Mozilla-based browsers Users of Mozilla-based browsers, such as Firefox, can disable the QuickTime plugin, as specified in the PluginDoc article Uninstalling Plugins. Disable file association for QuickTime files Disable the file association for QuickTime file types to help prevent windows applications from using Apple QuickTime to open QuickTime files. This can be accomplished by deleting the following registry keys: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\QuickTime.* This will remove the association for approximately 32 file types that are configured to open with the QuickTime Player software. Disable JavaScript For instructions on how to disable JavaScript, please refer to the Securing Your Web Browser document. This can help prevent some attack techniques that use the QuickTime plugin or ActiveX control. Do not access QuickTime files from untrusted sources Attackers may host malicious QuickTime files on web sites. To convince users to visit their sites, those attackers often use a variety of techniques to create misleading links, including URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, and intentional misspellings. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting.",
