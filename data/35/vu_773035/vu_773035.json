  "Description": "According to AutoFORM's website AutoFORM PDM Archive is a comprehensive output management solution that encompasses document creation, design and electronic distribution with a fully integrated online document archiving and viewing system. AutoFORM PDM Archive software contains multiple vulnerabilities. CWE-648: Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs CVE-2012-1827: 1. Unauthorized database access. Any application user is able to directly interact with almost all (administrative) application functions by using the AutoFORM PDM Archive webservice, regardless of the assigned roles or permissions. Thus, any application user is able to directly access the underlying application database in the role of the database user by using unsafe soap requests like \"initializeQueryDatabase2\", circumventing any application protection. CWE-287: Improper Authentication CVE-2012-1828: 2. Privilege escalation vulnerability. A non-administrative user can call administrative functions which are normally hidden. By calling, for example, the password-change function for the default administrators account directly, any user can change the administrators password without knowing the original one and thus gain administrative privileges. 3. Insecure deployment console which leads to system command execution. The application server contains the JBoss jmx-console (path /jmx-console/) which is password-protected. This protection is irrelevant due to the fact that AutoFORM PDM Archive application users are implemented as application server users, thus non-privileged users of AutoFORM PDM Archive are able to authenticate against the JBoss jmx-console. After authenticating, a user can upload a remote jsp-Script to the server by using a valid, remote deployment path and thus deploy a new application. CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') CVE-2012-1829: 4. Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. In AutoFORM PDM Archive, a lot of input fields are vulnerable because of the lack of input validation and/or output encoding. This poses an additional risk because administrative functions are in scope of the vulnerability, thus attacks against administrative users are possible.",
