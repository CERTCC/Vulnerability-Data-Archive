  "Vendor": "Netgear, Inc.",
  "VendorInformation": "We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.",
  "VendorRecordID": "CHEU-B2ST8E",
  "VendorReferences": "None",
  "VendorStatement": "NETGEAR is aware of the CERT CC IKE Protocol Vulnerability note and the mention of NETGEAR devices being affected. Currently shipping NETGEAR hardware products are not affected by this vulnerability because they do not implement IPSEC with IKE and Pre-Shared Keys. Older models that are no longer supported have provided IPSEC functionality; if those are still in service, the CERT advisory applies. Best practice when using Pre-Shared Keys is to ensure that Pre-Shared Keys are long and cryptographically strong. None of our currently shipping hardware products are affected."
