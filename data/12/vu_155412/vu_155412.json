  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker conducting a man-in-the-middle attack may be able to write arbitrary data to vulnerable devices checking for updates. Based on the frequency of SwiftKey update checks, which \"appears to be every 8 hours\" according to NowSecure researchers, such an attack may have a low likelihood of occurring.",

  "Description": "CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity - CVE-2015-4640 Samsung Galaxy S phones, including the S4 Mini, S4, S5, and S6, are pre-installed with a version of SwiftKey keyboard that is signed by Samsung to operate with system privileges. By design, SwiftKey periodically checks for language pack updates over HTTP (CVE-2015-4640). By intercepting such requests and modifying the necessary fields, an attacker can write arbitrary data to vulnerable devices. SwiftKey has stated that the \"vulnerability is unrelated to and does not affect our SwiftKey consumer apps on Google Play and the Apple App Store.\"",
