The Fedora project has\nanalyzed Fedora Core 4 and 5 binaries and determined that these\ndistributions are vulnerable to this issue. However this flaw does\nnot affect a default installation of Fedora Core; users who do not\nuse, or have not enabled, the Rewrite module are not affected by this\nissue. Updates to correct this issue are available, see\nhttp://fedora.redhat.com/Download/updates.html",
