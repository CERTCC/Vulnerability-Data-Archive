  "Description": "Several models of Hughes high-performance broadband satellite modems are potentially vulnerable to the following issues if not appropriately configured: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - CVE-2016-9494 The device's advanced status web page that is linked to from the basic status web page does not appear to properly parse malformed GET requests. This may lead to a denial of service. CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials - CVE-2016-9495 Access to the device's default telnet port (23) using one of a few default credentials shared among all devices. CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - CVE-2016-9496 An unauthenticated user may send an HTTP GET request to http://[ip]/com/gatewayreset or http://[ip]/cgi/reboot.bin to cause the modem to reboot. CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel - CVE-2016-9497 By default, port 1953 is accessible via telnet and does not require authentication. An unauthenticated remote user can access many administrative commands via this interface, including rebooting the modem. According to the reporter, the following models may be affected: HN7740S\nDW7000\nHN7000S/SM Other models may also be affected.",

  "Overview": "Several models of Hughes high-performance broadband satellite modems are potentially vulnerable to several issues if not appropriately configured.",
  "References": "",
  "Resolution": "Hughes has provided the following statement: \"The Hughes system has the ability to configure the modem which will prevent access and exploitation of the listed potential vulnerabilities. Hughes has provided service providers with documentation on the parameters and current software versions required to address these potential vulnerabilities. Customers should contact their service provider to ensure the locked down configuration is pushed to their devices.\" Update the firmware DW7000, HN7740S, and HN7000S/SM devices running software versions prior to 6.9.0.34 are vulnerable. Devices running 6.9.0.34 or higher can be configured to prevent exploit of the listed potential vulnerabilities.",
