  "Description": "CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal Emerson Network Power Avocent MergePoint Unity 2016 (MPU2016) KVM and possibly other model switches running firmware version 1.9.16473 and possibly previous versions contain a directory traversal vulnerability. This vulnerability is caused from a failure to sanitize the user-supplied input parameter \"filename\" within the download.php file. An attacker can use directory traversal to download critical files such as /etc/passwd to obtain the credentials for the device. It has been reported that Emerson Network Power Avocent MergePoint Unity KVM firmware version 1.2.3 through 1.10.10 are affected. It also has been reported that this firmware is shared among the entire MergePoint Unity KVM switch line. MPU104E\nMPU108E\nMPU1016\nMPU2016\nMPU2032\nMPU4032\nMPU8032",
