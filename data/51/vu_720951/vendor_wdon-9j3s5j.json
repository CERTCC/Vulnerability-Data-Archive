  "VendorInformation": "Recently a serious security vulnerability was discovered in the OpenSSL\ncryptographic software\nlibrary. MarkLogic application servers can be configured to use SSL, and\nMarkLogic uses OpenSSL to\nprovide this capability. A patch to OpenSSL has been released to address\nthis vulnerability, and\nMarkLogic has built patches for all impacted MarkLogic versions with\nOpenSSL 1.0.1g to incorporate\nthis new fix. Impacted Versions The following versions of MarkLogic are impacted by this vulnerability: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MarkLogic 5.0-5 through 5.0-6 \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All versions of MarkLogic 6.0 (6.0-1 through 6.0-5) \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All versions of MarkLogic 7.0 (7.0-1 through 7.0-2.2),\nincluding the MarkLogic AMIs MarkLogic versions prior to 5.0-5 use an earlier version of OpenSSL that\ndoes not have this\nvulnerability. How to Patch We recommend that customers who are using SSL patch their systems\nimmediately. To do this: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upgrade your cluster to the patch release, available at\nhttp://developer.marklogic.com/products. Patch release versions are as follows: o\u00a0\u00a0 MarkLogic 5.0-6.1 o\u00a0\u00a0 MarkLogic 6.0-5.1 o\u00a0\u00a0 MarkLogic 7.0-2.3 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regenerate all SSL certificates for your cluster. This is\nnecessary because the\nvulnerability is such that private keys for your certificates are\npotentially compromised. See\n\u201cConfiguring SSL on App Servers\u201d in the documentation: o\u00a0\u00a0 MarkLogic 5 documentation: http://docs.marklogic.com/5.0/guide/admin/SSL#chapter o\u00a0\u00a0 MarkLogic 6 documentation: http://docs.marklogic.com/6.0/guide/admin/SSL#chapter o\u00a0\u00a0 MarkLogic 7 documentation: http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/admin/SSL#chapter 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If you are using BASIC or Application Level Authentication over\nSSL, have all your\nusers change their passwords after you've patched and deployed new SSL\ncertificates. This includes\nboth internal users in our security database, and anyone using external\nauthentication (which\nrequires BASIC authentication over SSL). This is necessary because the\nvulnerability may have\nresulted in password leaks. If you have any questions about how to patch, feel free to contact\nsupport@marklogic.com.
