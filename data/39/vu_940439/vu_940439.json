  "Description": "CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer - CVE-2018-5378 (Quagga-2018-0543) The Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, does not properly bounds check the data sent with a NOTIFY to a peer, if an attribute length is invalid. Arbitrary data from the bgpd process may be sent over the network to a peer and/or it may crash. CWE-415: Double Free - CVE-2018-5379 (Quagga-2018-1114) The Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, can double-free memory when processing certain forms of UPDATE message, containing cluster-list and/or unknown attributes. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read - CVE-2018-5380 (Quagga-2018-1550) The Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, can overrun internal BGP code-to-string conversion tables used for debug by 1 pointer value, based on input. CWE-228: Improper Handling of Syntactically Invalid Structure - CVE-2018-5381 (Quagga-2018-1975) The Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, had a bug in its parsing of \"Capabilities\" in BGP OPEN messages, in the bgp_packet.c:bgp_capability_msg_parse function. The parser can enter an infinite loop on invalid capabilities if a Multi-Protocol capability does not have a recognized AFI/SAFI. For more information, please see Quagga's version 1.2.3 release announcement. The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2018-5379.",
