  "Workarounds": "Apply a Microsoft Fix It utility Microsoft has released Microsoft Fix it 50939 to address this vulnerability. The Fix It utility requires that all previous Windows security updates are installed to function properly. Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit The Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this and other vulnerabilities. Enable DEP in Microsoft Windows Consider enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but it can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts \"Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology\" part 1 and part 2. DEP should be used in conjunction with the application of patches or other mitigations described in this document. Note that when relying on DEP for exploit mitigation, it is important to use a system that supports Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as well. ASLR is not supported by Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 or earlier. ASLR was introduced with Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Please see the Microsoft SRD blog entry: On the effectiveness of DEP and ASLR for more details. The MSRC blog post lists the following mitigations for this vulnerability. Set Internet and local intranet security zone settings to \"High\" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones\nThis will help prevent exploitation but may affect usability; therefore, trusted sites should be added to the Internet Explorer Trusted Sites zone to minimize disruption. Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and local intranet security zones\nThis will help prevent exploitation but can affect usability, so trusted sites should be added to the Internet Explorer Trusted Sites zone to minimize disruption. Use a different web browser Until Microsoft has released a patch for this vulnerability, consider using a different web browser for viewing untrusted web sites.",
