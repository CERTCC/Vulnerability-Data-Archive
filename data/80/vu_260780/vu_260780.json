  "Description": "NetNanny installs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) proxy as well as a new trusted root CA certificate. The certificate used by NetNanny is shared among all installations of NetNanny. Furthermore, the private key used to generate the certificate is also shared and may be obtained in plaintext directly from the software. An attacker may use this shared private key to generate new certificates that would be signed by and therefore trusted by NetNanny. An affected user would not be alerted to a false malicious HTTPS website as NetNanny would trust the spoofed certificate. NetNanny has provided more information on this issue on their FAQ. We have confirmed that NetNanny version 7.2.4.2 is affected. Other versions may also be affected. For more information on the impact of this issue on SSL inspection, please see Will Dormann's CERT/CC blog post on SSL Inspection.",
