  "Description": "The Vertiv Avocent UMG-4000 contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an authenticated attacker with administrative privileges to remotely execute arbitrary code. The web interface does not sanitize input provided from the remote client, making it vulnerable to command injection, stored cross-site scripting, and reflected cross-site scripting. CVE-2019-9507 - CWE-95\nThe web interface of the Avocent UMG-4000 version 4.2.1.19 is vulnerable to command injection because the application incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before executing. Since all commands within the web application are executed as root, this could allow a remote attacker authenticated with an administrator account to execute arbitrary commands. The CVSS 2.0 score below is based on CVE-2019-9507. CVE-2019-9508 - CWE-79\nThe web interface of the Avocent UMG-4000 version 4.2.1.19 is vulnerable to stored XSS. A remote attacker authenticated with an administrator account could store a maliciously named file within the web application that would execute each time a user browsed to the page. CVE-2019-9509 - CWE-79\nThe web interface of the Avocent UMG-4000 version 4.2.1.19 is vulnerable to reflected XSS in an HTTP POST parameter. The web application does not neutralize user-controllable input before displaying to users in a web page, which could allow a remote attacker authenticated with a user account to execute arbitrary code.",
