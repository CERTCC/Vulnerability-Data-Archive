  "Description": "189809\t2018-10-02 Ultimate Member \u2013 User Profile & Membership Plugin for WordPress /admin/templates/role/role-edit.php id Parameter Reflected XSS Ultimate Member \u2013 User Profile & Membership Plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that allows a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the /admin/templates/role/role-edit.php script does not properly sanitize input to the 'id' GET parameter before returning it to users. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to create a specially crafted request that executes arbitrary script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between their browser and the server. hosted by wordpress https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-member/\nFixed: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/security-vulenrability/\nDescription: https://secure.helpscout.net/docs/561c9af29033600a7a36d66d/article/5b7692f90428631d7a8a1643/ \"Versions of Ultimate Member other than 2.0.23+ and 1.3.89 contain a security vulnerability, allowing attackers to upload malicious php files. You should update your site to the latest version immediately if you have not already. You should also update the social activity extension to latest version if you are using this extension. We have closed the security vulnerability in 2.0.23+ (and 1.3.89 for users who have not updated to 2.0 yet. You may use WP Rollback plugin for upgrading to 1.3.89) but the consequences of the infection can remain on your site.\"",
