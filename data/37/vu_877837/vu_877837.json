  "Description": "CVE-2018-5404: The Quest Kace System Management (K1000) Appliance allows an authenticated, remote attacker with least privileges ('User Console Only' role) to potentially exploit multiple Blind SQL Injection vulnerabilities to retrieve sensitive information from the database or copy the entire database. (CWE-89) CVE-2018-5405: The Quest Kace System Management  (K1000) Appliance allows an authenticated least privileged user with \u2018User Console Only\u2019 rights to potentially inject arbitrary JavaScript code on the tickets page. Script execution could allow a malicious user of the system to steal session cookies of other users including Administrator and take over their session. This can further be exploited to launch other attacks. The software also does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. (CWE-79) CVE-2018-5406: The Quest Kace System Management  (K1000) Appliance allows a remote attacker to exploit the misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) mechanism. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform sensitive actions such as adding a new administrator account or changing the appliance\u2019s settings. A malicious internal user could also gain administrator privileges of this appliance and use it to visit a malicious link that exploits this vulnerability. This could cause the application to perform sensitive actions such as adding a new administrator account or changing the appliance\u2019s settings. (CWE-284)",

  "Impact": "An authenticated remote attacker could leverage  Blind SQL injections to obtain sensitive data. An authenticated user with \"user console only\" rights may inject arbitrary JavaScript, which could result in an attacker taking over a session of others, including an Administrator. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could add an administrator-level account or change the appliance's settings.",
