  "Description": "This is an old vulnerability that continues to be a problem for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. The underlying ability to allow the fallback to earlier versions of TLS or SSL in the event either the client or server is incompatible with the latest versions of SSL/TLS will ensure the vulnerability will continue to re-occur. A vulnerability in the way the SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 protocols select the initialization vector (IV) when operating in cipher-block chaining (CBC) modes allows an attacker to perform a chosen-plaintext attack on encrypted traffic. This vulnerability has been addressed in TLS 1.3 protocol.",
  "ID": "VU#875537",
  "IDNumber": "875537",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An adjacent, unauthenticated attacker may be able to decrypt the contents of an SSL- or TLS-encrypted session. This could allow the attacker to recover authentication token from HTTPS requests (to hijack authenticated sessions), or other potentially sensitive information.",

  "Overview": "HTTPS utilizing TLS versions prior to 1.3 supports outdated cyptographic modes vulnerable to MITM and leaking information.",

  "Workarounds": "Implement TLS 1.3 and stop using TLS CBC ciphers. Note that both the web servers and the client web browser must support TLS 1.3 for these workarounds to be effective. The session will fallback to an earlier version of the TLS or SSL protocol in the event that either is incompatible with TLS 1.3."
