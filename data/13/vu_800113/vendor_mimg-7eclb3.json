  "VendorStatement": "Openwall GNU/*/Linux (Owl) 2.0-stable and current used versions of BIND\nthat did not randomize query source port numbers. This has been\ncorrected by updating to BIND 9.3.5-P1 in Owl-current on July 8th and in\nOwl 2.0-stable on July 11th, 2008. Query IDs were already being\nrandomized by versions of BIND in supported branches of Owl. Additionally, the DNS resolver in our revision of the GNU C Library\n(glibc) had been modified to randomize query IDs in year 2000, before\nOwl was first made available to the general public. However, it was\nnot, and it still has not been, modified to randomize source ports as\nwell. With these issues getting more attention lately, this is being\nconsidered as a higher priority task now. Also relevant is the fact that running our \"userland\" with a recent\nLinux kernel (2.6.24 or newer) introduces randomization of source port\nnumbers for UDP-based queries, although added security of this setup has\nnot been fully evaluated (specifically, whether new port numbers are\nallocated for every query in all cases and whether the produced sequence\nof random port numbers is sufficiently cryptographically secure).",
