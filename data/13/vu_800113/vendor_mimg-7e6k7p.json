  "VendorStatement": "ISC is providing patches for BIND 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5 (tagged -P1) that\nimplement measures to enhance resilience against this sort of attack. BIND accomplishes this by including the use of the source port queries\nas additional information that would need to be predicted by a\nsuccessful attack. ISC is also making beta releases, BIND 9.5.1b1 and 9.4.3b2 available\nfor download and testing. These beta releases provide the same\nimproved resiliency as the patches but with better performance for\nservers with query volumes at or above 10,000 queries per second. They are however betas, not fully tested production releases. The\npatches,(P1 versions), are fully tested today and released for\nproduction use. Older versions of BIND 9 and BIND 8 will not be\npatched as they are EOL. ISC notes that even with these measures, the nature of the DNS\nprotocol is such that attacks of this nature may still succeed. The\nonly solution to fully counter this sort of attack is to deploy DNSSEC\nin DNS zones and enable DNSSEC validation in the resolvers.",
