  "Impact": "An attacker with the ability to conduct a successful cache poisoning attack can cause a nameserver's clients to contact the incorrect, and possibly malicious, hosts for particular services. Consequently, web traffic, email, and other important network data can be redirected to systems under the attacker's control.",

  "Resolution": "Apply a patch from the vendor\nA number of vendors have released patches to implement source port randomization in the nameserver. This change significantly reduces the practicality of cache poisoning attacks. Please see the Systems Affected portion of this document for additional details for specific vendors. Additional information about Japanese vendors can be found in JPCERT/CC JVNVU#800113. Stub resolvers are also vulnerable to these attacks, so system administrators should patch stub resolvers that issue queries in response to attacker behavior and that may receive packets from an attacker. Administrators should watch for patches to client operating systems that implement port randomization in the stub resolver. <a name=pat> Note: Routers, firewalls, proxies, and other gateway devices that perform Network Address Translation (NAT)--more specifically Port Address Translation (PAT)--often rewrite source ports in order to track connection state. When modifying source ports, PAT devices can reduce source port randomness implemented by nameservers and stub resolvers (conversely, a PAT device can also increase randomness). A PAT device can reduce or eliminate improvements gained by patching DNS software to implement source port randomization.",

  "Workarounds": "Restrict access\nAdministrators, particularly those who are unable to apply a patch, can limit exposure to this vulnerability by restricting sources that can ask for recursion. Note that restricting access will still allow attackers with access to authorized hosts to exploit this vulnerability. The document \"Securing an Internet Name Server\" contains instructions for restricting recursion in ISC BIND. Filter traffic at network perimeters\nBecause the ability to spoof IP addresses is necessary to conduct these attacks, administrators should filter spoofed addresses at the network perimeter. IETF Request for Comments (RFC) documents RFC 2827, RFC 3704, and RFC 3013 describe best current practices (BCPs) for implementing this defense. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. Run a local DNS cache\nIn lieu of strong port randomization characteristics in a stub resolver, administrators can protect their systems by using local caching full-service resolvers both on the client systems and on servers that are topologically close (on the network) to the client systems. These resolvers should be used in conjunction with the network segmentation and filtering strategies mentioned above. Disable recursion\nDisable recursion on any nameserver responding to DNS requests made by untrusted systems. \"Securing an Internet Name Server\" contains instructions for disabling recursion in various versions of ISC's BIND. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-81 \"Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide\" contains detailed and thorough information about the secure deployment of DNS servers, including the recommendations above. Administrators are strongly encouraged to review this document and consider implementing the recommendations it describes. Implement source port randomization\nVendors that implement DNS software are encouraged to review IETF Internet Draft \"Measures for making DNS more resilient against forged answers\" for additional information about implementing mitigations in their products. This document is a work in progress and may change prior to its publication as an RFC, if it is approved. System implementers may also wish to review IETF Internet Draft \"Port Randomization\" for a more generalized approach to how port randomization can mitigate some other types of spoofing attacks. As noted above, routers, firewalls, and other gateway devices that perform NAT/PAT may modify source ports in ways that reduce the effectiveness of source port randomization.",
