  "Description": "NCR is a global company which develops and supports hardware and software for digital banking, ATMs, point of sale transactions. The NCR SelfServ 6622 (S1 and S2) running APTRA XFS 05.01.00 are ATMs running older software which may be vulnerable to physical attacks. If an attacker can gain physical access to the communications bus, and depending on the vulnerability, he may gain control of the ATM host computer, execute arbitrary code or dispense cash. CVE-2020-9063\nPhysical access to the bus between the human interface devices (HID) and cash dispenser can be accomplished by an attacker. The communication bus between the HID and the dispenser is vulnerable to buffer overflow, which could result in the insertion of malicious payload or execution of arbitrary code with SYSTEM rights. (CWE-288) CVE-2020-10123\nPhysical access to the bus between the host computer and the cash dispenser can allow an attacker to intercept the weak session key and generate a new session key to send commands to the cash dispenser to dispense cash. The session key was designed to protect communication between the host computer and the cash dispenser. (CWE-326)",

  "Overview": "NCR SelfServ 6622 (S1 and S2) (or ATMs of the same manufacturer with the same set of software) running APTRA XFS 05.01.00, are vulnerable to physical attacks on the communications bus between the human interface device, host computer, and the cash dispenser.",

  "Resolution": "Vendor software and/or hardware updates are required. APTRA XFS 05.01 was released in 2010, and discontinued for support in 2015. Any customer still using unsupported software should upgrade at the earliest possible opportunity. NCR continues to recommend their customers to configure NCR ATM Currency Dispensers to Level 3 Physical Protection. For all NCR customers who have configured Level 3 Protection as a protection against Black Box attacks on S1 and S2 dispensers, this firmware upgrade is critical to support that protection. Firmware: The minimum version of firmware was released in APTRA XFS Dispenser Security Update 01.00.00 in September 2018. This contains: \u2022 S1: USBCurrencyDispenser 04.01.01, firmware 0x0167 \n\u2022 S2: USBMediaDispenser 03.04.00, firmware 0x0118 \nConfiguration Requirements: In addition to the Dispenser Security Update 01.00.00, there are two critical parameters which MUST be configured correctly. These are \n\u2022 Dispenser Protection Level: Level 3, Physical Protection \n\u2022 Dispenser Authentication Sequence: S1 dispensers, set the Dispenser authentication Sequence to Level 2\nLevel 3 authentication requires that the PC Core is running valid NCR APTRA XFS Currency Dispenser Software which supports the appropriate authentication sequence. These updates address both CVE-2020-9063 and CVE-2020-10123.",
