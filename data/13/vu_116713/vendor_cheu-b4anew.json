  "VendorStatement": "The security of NCR\u2019s cash dispenser module is critically important, and NCR continuously upgrades and improves the resistance of these modules to attack, including the class of attack known as \u2018black box\u2019 where the attacker has access to the communications cable to the dispenser. NCR advises all customers that it is critically important that APTRA XFS software is kept up to date to ensure that the latest security patches are always installed. We note that the version of software referenced in this report, APTRA XFS 05.01 was released in 2010, and discontinued for support in 2015. Any customer still using unsupported software should upgrade at the earliest possible opportunity. For advice on upgrade versions, NCR would direct our customers to the latest advisory for dispenser software, attached, which will protect from all known \u2018Black Box\u2019 attack methods, including the issues identified in this report."
