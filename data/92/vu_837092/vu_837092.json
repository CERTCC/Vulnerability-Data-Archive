  "Resolution": "Apply an update\nThis issue is addressed with the FLEXnet Connect 11.0.1 client, which comes with agent.exe version 11.1.100.17104. This version of FLEXnet Connect includes the ability to verify certificates that are provided by the FLEXnet Connect server. A FLEXnet Connect server that uses signed communication will add an X-FNC-Sig HTTP header to outgoing messages. This signature is designed to prevent the server response from being successfully modified by an attacker. The signature checking is also designed to ensure that the FLEXnet Connect client is connecting to an authentic FLEXnet Connect server, much in the same way that HTTPS helps to ensure the identity of a web site. Note that the originally-released version of the FLEXnet Connect 11.0.1 client, which came with agent.exe version 11.1.100.16604, did not completely address this vulnerability. Note that the FLEXnet Connect 11.0.1 SDK does not enable secure communications by default, but the updates.installshield.com FLEXnet Connect server is currently distributing an update that enables this feature. This means that if a system's DNS has been hijacked or if the communications with the FLEXnet Connect update server are modified before this update can be retrieved, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the client system. Because the fixed version of the FLEXnet Connect runtime is relatively new (it was digitally signed on September 26, 2008), it is likely to take some time before software that is packaged with FLEXnet Connect will receive the update and also configure FLEXnet Connect to verify signatures. For this reason, we recommend the following workarounds:",

  "Workarounds": "Block outbound requests that contain the string /GetRules.asp It may be possible to prevent this vulnerability from being exploited by filtering outbound URLs that contain the string /GetRules.asp.

Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{551E5190-19C7-4626-9D54-FB20355E6467}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{5B7524C8-2446-40E9-9474-94A779DBA224}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{8D9BB053-FEE5-4411-B6F5-F1E37DDC3106}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{EE4E49B0-38EC-4C23-A7A6-2E190B5E3418}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{FFF2D28F-E4EE-44D9-8104-8E71556757F6}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\nNote that this list of CLSIDs may not be complete. Different versions of FLEXnet Connect or InstallShield Update Service use different CLSIDs for the ActiveX control that can be used to trigger updates. Restrict access to the FLEXnet Conect client components The vulnerable update components can be disabled by restricting access to the ISSCH.EXE and ISUSPM.EXE components on Microsoft Windows Systems. These executable files are for the InstallShield Update Service Scheduler and the Macrovision FLEXnet Connect Update Manager, respectively. These programs are used to periodically check for software updates using FLEXnet Connect. Users may also wish to rename the \"\\Program Files\\Common Files\\InstallShield\\UpdateService\" or related UpdateManager folders of other products to prevent automated execution of these programs until a fix is provided. Note that this may interfere with a product's ability to retrieve updates, including security fixes. Disable ActiveX Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the \"Securing Your Web Browser\" document.\u00a0",
