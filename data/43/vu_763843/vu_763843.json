  "Description": "CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CVE-2016-6557 The RP-AC52 web interface does not sufficiently verify whether a valid request was intentionally provided by the user. An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request. CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') - CVE-2016-6558 A command injection vulnerability exists in apply.cgi on the RP-AC52 web interface specifically in the action_script parameter. The action_script parameter specifies a script to be executed if the action_mode parameter does not contain a valid state. If the input provided by action_script does not match one of the hard coded options, then it  will be executed as the argument of either a system() or an eval() call allowing arbitrary commands to be executed. The most recent version of the RP-AC52 firmware, version 1.0.1.1s, has been confirmed vulnerable by the researcher. Source code analysis would indicate that earlier versions are vulnerable as well. Based on a source code analysis of firmware version 1.0.1.1q  the following devices are also suspected to be vulnerable: EA-N66\n     RP-N12\n     RP-N14\n     RP-N53\n     RP-AC56\n     WMP-N12 The CVSS score below reflects CVE-2016-6557.",

As a general good security practice, only allow trusted hosts to connect to the LAN. Implement strong passwords for WiFi and for the web management interface. Strong passwords can help to prevent blind guessing attempts that would establish sessions for CSRF attacks.",
