  "Description": "Exim is a message transfer agent (MTA) that can be used on Unix-like operating systems. Exim versions from (and including) 4.92 up to (and including) 4.92.2 are vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in string_vformat. It fails to properly handle long Extended HELO (EHLO) strings that can crash the Exim process receiving the message. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial or service or execute arbitrary code. While at this mode of operation Exim already dropped its privileges, other paths to reach the vulnerable code may exist.",
