  "Description": "OpenSMTPD is an open-source server-side implementation of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) that is part of the OpenBSD Project. OpenSMTPD's smtp_mailaddr() function is responsible for validating sender and recipient mail addresses. If the local part of an address is invalid and the domain name is empty, smtp_mailaddr() will automatically add a domain name as opposed to failing because of the invalid local address. This will allow the invalid local address to pass through the function without validation.",
  "ID": "VU#390745",
  "IDNumber": "390745",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "An attacker could send a malformed SMTP message that will bypass the smtp_mailaddr() validation and execute arbitrary code. This could allow a local attacker to escalate their privileges, and allow either a local or remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as root.",
  "Keywords": [
    "OpenBSD",
    "RCE",
    "LPE",
    "smtp"
  ],
  "Overview": "Qualys Research Labs found that the smtp_mailaddr() function in OpenSMTPD version 6.6 does not properly sanitize user input, which could allow a local attacker to escalate their privileges, and allow either a local or remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as root.",
