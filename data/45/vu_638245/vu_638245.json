  "Description": "The vulnerability is in the commons-fileupload component, which is the built-in file upload mechanism for Struts. It affects any app that was built using Struts 2.3.x, as those versions include the vulnerable commons-fileupload 1.3.2 library. The bug is actually rather old, and researchers disclosed it to the Apache Software Foundation in 2016. At the time, Apache released a patched version of the library, which was included in Struts 2.5.x. The Apache Struts Team recommends to immediately upgrade your Struts 2.3.36 based projects to use the latest released version of Commons FileUpload library, which is currently 1.3.3. This is necessary to prevent your publicly accessible web site from being exposed to possible Remote Code Execution attacks. This affects Struts 2.3.36 and prior. Struts versions from 2.5.12 are already using the latest commons-fileupload version. Your project is affected if it uses the built-in file upload mechanism of Struts 2, which defaults to the use of commons-fileupload. The updated commons-fileupload library is a drop-in replacement for the vulnerable version. Deployed applications can be hardened by replacing the commons-fileupload jar file in WEB-INF/lib with the fixed jar.",
