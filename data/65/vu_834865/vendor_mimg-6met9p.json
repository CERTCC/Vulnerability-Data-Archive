If that is not possible, source code patches are available for 8.12.11 and 8.13.5, but these are fairly extensive and may be difficult to apply cleanly. There are no patches available for 8.11, nor will there be, since 8.11 and earlier versions do not have the necessary support infrastructure. Further information is available at http://www.sendmail.org. Sendmail, Inc. Sendmail, Inc. recommends patching commercial products incorporating the sendmail MTA (including all current versions of Sendmail Switch, Sendmail Multi-Switch, Sendmail Managed MTA, and Sendmail Message Store/SAMS on all systems except Windows, as well as Sendmail Sentrion.
