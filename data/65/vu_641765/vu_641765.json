  "Description": "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') - CVE-2018-5391\nThe Linux kernel, versions 3.9+, is vulnerable to a denial of service attack with low rates of specially modified packets targeting IP fragment re-assembly. An attacker may cause a denial of service condition by sending specially crafted IP fragments. Various vulnerabilities in IP fragmentation have been discovered and fixed over the years. The current vulnerability (CVE-2018-5391) became exploitable in the Linux kernel with the increase of the IP fragment reassembly queue size.",

  "Workarounds": "If you are unable to apply a patch, see the following mitigations: Modify Default Configurations\nChange the (default) values of net.ipv4/ipv6.ipfrag_high_thresh and net.ipv4/ipv6.ipfrag_low_thresh back to 256kB and 192 kB (respectively) or below. Example: sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh=196608\nsysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh=262144\nsysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh=196608\nsysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh=262144 Update: Further testing shows that these mitigations are not a 100% fix. A significantly strong attack will still result in a denial of service condition. Revert Commit\nAnother sufficient mitigation is to revert the commit c2a936600f78aea00d3312ea4b66a79a4619f9b4"
