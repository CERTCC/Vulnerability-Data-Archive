  "VendorStatement": "Microsoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability (named \"FragmentSmack\" CVE-2018-5391) affecting Windows systems. An attacker could send many 8-byte sized IP fragments with random starting offsets, but withhold the last fragment and exploit the worst-case complexity of linked lists in reassembling IP fragments. A system under attack would become unresponsive with 100% CPU utilization but would recover as soon as the attack terminated. To protect your system from this vulnerability, Microsoft recommends that you take the following actions: 1) Register for security notifications mailer to be alerted of content changes to this advisory. See Microsoft Technical Security Notifications. 2) Test and apply security updates. See the Affected Products table to download and install the updates. 3) If you cannot apply the security updates immediately, you can apply the workaround described in FAQ #1."
