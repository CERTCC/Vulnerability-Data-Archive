  "Description": "iOS contains an unspecified kernel vulnerability. This vulnerability can allow code execution with kernel privileges. This vulnerability is being used by the public unc0ver 5.0 jailbreak utility, which claims to support all devices from iOS 11 through 13.5, excluding versions 12.3-12.3.2 and 12.4.2-12.4.5. It is also reported that this jailbreak works on modern iOS devices that use a CPU that supports Pointer Authentication Code (PAC), which indicates that PAC does not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.",
  "ID": "VU#127371",
  "IDNumber": "127371",
  "IPProtocol": "",
  "Impact": "By convincing a user to install a malicious application on a device running iOS, an attacker may be able to achieve arbitrary code execution that is not restricted by sandboxes or other iOS protections.",
  "Keywords": "unc0ver 5.0",
  "Overview": "iOS contains an unspecified kernel vulnerability, which can allow a malicious application to achieve unsandboxed, kernel-level code execution.",
