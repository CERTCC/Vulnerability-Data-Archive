  "Description": "The Rapid7 advisory states: CVE-2012-4956 - Heap Overflow\nWhen handling requests of name \"SRS\", the NFRAgent.exe fails to generate a response in a secure way, copying user controlled data into a fixed-length buffer in the heap without bounds checking. This vulnerability can result in remote code execution under the context of the SYSTEM account. CVE-2012-4957 - Arbitrary File Retrieval\nWhen handling requests on \"/FSF/CMD\" for records with NAME \"SRS\", OPERATION \"4\" and CMD \"103\" the NFRAgent.exe allows a remote unauthenticated user to retrieve arbitrary remote files, specified with the tag \"PATH\", with SYSTEM privileges. CVE-2012-4958 - Arbitrary File Retrieval\nWhen handling requests on \"/FSF/CMD\" for records with NAME \"FSFUI\" and UICMD \"126\" the NFRAgent.exe allows a remote unauthenticated user to retrieve arbitrary remote text files, specified with the tag \"FILE\", with SYSTEM privileges. CVE-2012-4959 - Arbitrary File Upload\nWhen handling requests on \"/FSF/CMD\" for records with NAME \"FSFUI\" and UICMD \"130\" the NFRAgent.exe allows a remote unauthenticated user to upload files to the host, specified with the tag \"FILE\", with SYSTEM privileges. It allows to execute remote code with SYSTEM privileges. Additional details may be found in the Rapid7 blog post entitled \"New 0day Exploits: Novell File Reporter Vulnerabilities.\"",
